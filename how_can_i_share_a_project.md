# How can I share a project? 
*How to share and document the process and the work of your project *




## Why document?
Honestly, documentation isn't an easy task. Once you are focused on the job you are doing and the tinkering it sometimes becomes a burden that you have to worry about making documents of how stuff has developed and how things work, but documentation isn'ta burden, it is a real treasure, and here is why:
1. The clearer your documentation, the more engaged online community you can grow
2. The more you document, the more you tell the story of your product, which is a great asset for media coverage, supporters, and again, your online community
3. Documentation helps you (yes, you!) keep track of your thoughts, how and where you have started and how you end now.
4. If you can't present it, then something is wrong. Being able to organize your thougts and guide your community through replicating how following your project is a skill that you have to master in order for your project to survive.
