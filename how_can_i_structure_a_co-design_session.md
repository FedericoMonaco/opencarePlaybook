# How can I structure a co-design session? 


#### // How is this chapter structured?

The aim of this chapter is to produce a general but at the same time complete overview on participatory design activities.
In the **Introduction** we will provide the methodology, we will explain the details and we will show you how we have applied the theory to a practical/real life example.

(Beware: all the theoretical information is fundamental, especially if this is the first time that you are bumping into the co-design world.)

Therefore, first of all you will have the possibility to understand **[What is a co-design session](what_is_a_co-design_session.md)**, by reading its **Definition** and reflecting on its real meaning.
Once you will have got the essence of the topic, you can read throughout the different **Characteristics** of the collaborative design discipline.
We will then complete the methodological section by listing the different and peculiar **Typologies and approaches** of co-design.

In order to make you understand in an efficient way the theory we will move to a practical example, **[Our experience in co-design field](our_experience_in_co-design_field.md)**. In this subchapter we will introduce our tangible experience and right after it we will explain the reason **[Why we decided to organize a co-design session](why_we_decided_to_organize_a_co-design_session.md)**.

Once you will have completed the Introduction you will have a basic knowledge of collaborative design activity.

This may be enough for you, but in case your aim is to organize and develop a participatory design session, we warmly suggest you to keep reading the **[Tips](tips.md)**.
These are pieces of cakes, simple rules that, if correctly followed, can allow you to achieve your goal in the most efficient way.

Each Tip will be divided in two: a general/theoretical description and a practical example related to our co-design experience.

In the end, in order to sum up all the contents mentioned above, we will provide a **[Survival table of contents for a co-design session](overview__survival_table_of_contents_for_a_co-desi.md)**, based on our **opencare** experience.
