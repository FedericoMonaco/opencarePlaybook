# How can I make a workshop happen?

A hands-on workshop is usually a very good way to engage local communities and to find people interested in the project.
However organizing a workshop is also usually time intensive and requires a lot of effort in terms of research, planning, logistics and communication.

There are many different kinds of workshops you can offer to your community, but mostly they can be grouped in four main categories:
- [Educational workshop](workshop_categories.md#educational-workshop)
- [Ideation workshop](workshop_categories.md#Ideation-workshop)
- [Experiential workshop](workshop_categories.md#Experiential-workshop)
- [Innovation workshop](workshop_categories.md#Innovation-workshop)

Workshops can be approached in different ways according to the category they belong to, but there are common issues that we can cover and analyze separately. A compendium of [best practices](workshop_best_practices.md) has been collected to make your life easier!
