# Why opencare? [Costantino]


## Where does the idea come from?


## What is care?
Aside from being a word that we use regularly, the meaning of "care" might have different interpretations:
1. 
*Care referred to a special kind of human interaction*: someone (the care giver) gives attention to, and takes action for, someone else (the care receiver).
2. 
*Care referred to a set of artifacts*: the products and services of the system which, in a given time and place, enables the care activities (i.e. the care interaction of the point 1).

## What is open?
*Open source, open data, open knowledge, open mind...* What exactly is the meaning of "open" in the contemporary world?

A succinct summary from the *Open Definition* website ([http://opendefinition.org/](http://opendefinition.org/)):

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

Starting from this assumption, "open" could gain a more complex meaning withing the field of care:

A.
*Open referred to the care system:* a system is open when different actors have the possibility to play a role. This can happen when the whole activity package is opened and divided into parts with the possibility, for these different parts, to be distributed among different actors.

B.
*Open referred to the information flow:* a system is open when the information on which it is based are open. This can happen when these information are totally visible, accessible and transferable to other systems.

## What is opencare then?
Considering the different meanings of “care” and “open” there is a clear correlation between 1 and A, and between 2 and B:

A1.
*Open care refers to the final result.* That is, it refers to the characteristics of the care system we intend to create: a care system where different actors (experts and non experts) are in condition to play a relevant role.

B2.
*Open care refers to the design/production process.* That is, it refers to the characteristics of a co-design and co-production process: the process leading to the realization of the products and services on which an aimed care system is based.

## What is the value of community participation?
mention co-design here

## I just have simple ideas in my mind and I don’t have a team, can I even start?

## Do I have to be a maker to grow a community around my idea?
