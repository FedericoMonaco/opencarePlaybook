Why is a workshop good for the community?
- it makes people share an experience in a informal way, creating a space of trust and making them feeling less isolated as a result
- it makes people collaborate to solve concrete problems
- it makes people feel empowered when facing again at issues in their everyday life

Why is a workshop good for you?
- it creates trust in you by the community
- it makes the people in the community understand the limits of what you are planning to do
- it gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project
- people might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project

### General notes

If your project is inspired by an idea that helps your local community, make sure your emphasis the fact that it can help solve a problem or create opportunities in your local community.
1. **Language:** Make sure your communicate in languages that are understandable by your local community
2. **Relate to your community problems**, present your project from the scope of the local community
If you are replicating/localizing an existing global project make sure your localize your materials to make it easy to involve your local community.
3.**Understand your local community: ** Spend time understanding why they are interested in your project.  Make sure you engage them in the scope they are interested in, for example: A geek who wants to tinker has a different interest from a person who wants to eventually use your project/product

####Find your Friends?
1.Which **makerspaces** can help you work on your project?
2.If there is no makerspace nearby, can you host sessions in a near **co-working** space?
3.If you don't have makerpaces or co-working or any modern facility, can you meet at the library or community center in the **neighbourhood?** (with this approach, however, you need to have existing team and community to start with)
4.If your project relates to a medical cause, or industrial, or elderly, etc, layout the scope of your project, and reach out to **related organizations**, or groups 

####What are the activities  that help grow a local community?
Depending on which stage your project is in, there are a number of activities that you can carry out:
1. **An ideation workshop**,  A workshop where people share their thoughts around similar solutions of the project/product you are producing.
2. **A Hackathon** if you have a list of tasks that need to be added to your project you may want to organize an event and ask people to contribute specific things.
3. **A testing workhoshop**: A session where you test early prototypes with the community, let them use it, take notes and learn from their feedback.

####Connecting the dots:
1. Make sure you **build connections** between the community of the makerspace and the new community that your bring for your project.
2. Ensure that the local community can **work together** nicely.
3. In tech projects, **female participation **is could be challenging. Make sure females on your project are welcomed, trusted and can participate in areas that they are interested in.
3. **Follow up after the meeting**: Whether you have a facebook group, or another online venue that the local community is found together on, make sure you follow up and remain in contact.
