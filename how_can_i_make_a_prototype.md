# How can I make a prototype? [Alessandro]

## Is there a process I can follow?
design process, what it is, why it's powerful, how you can use it for prototyping

??? 
- different kinds of prototypes
- testing for feedback
- prototyping with hardware



## What kind of technologies can I use?
Rapid prototyping techniques

### 3D printing  [Moushira]
3D printing is a technology usedto create plastic shapes from 3D models.  There is a wide variety of 3D printers available, that start from as cheap as 150 Euro to as expensive as 10K Euro.  Stability, speed, and quality of finished product are all factors that control the price.    For simple prototyping we need a machine that can produce decent results, you can use the guide here for comparisons on which machine to buy https://www.3dhubs.com/best-3d-printer-guide and what results to expect.   
The file format for your files needs to be in STL, which you can generate using a wide variety of software, starting from commerical pro packages such as Solidworks, or other 3D alternatives such as Opencad, or for simple prints you can use a cloud service such as 

### Laser cutting [Moushira]
Laser cutting is a technology used for cutting flat surfaces of wood, plastic, or cardboard and paper.  Metal and resins (and of course mirrors!) are not materials that you can use laser technology with, to work with those you can explore other technologies like milling.   Depending on the laser power of the machine you are using (form 40W to 100W mostly) you can adjust the laser power and speed to for perfect results with your material thickness.  Adjusting speed and power we can also use laser for engraving or itching, which is simply used for drawing on a surface. 
The machine operator is familiar with the adjustments needed for each machine based on experience, and guidebook. If you are using the machine for the first time, allow time for trial and error.    Laser cutting uses 2D files in different formats.  Below are a few links that include tips on how to use and fine tune your machine:
