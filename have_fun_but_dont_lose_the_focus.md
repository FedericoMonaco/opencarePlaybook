BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE - REWARD

In the meaning that the organizational team has always to keep in mind that **the participants might not be familiar** in doing some activities and reasonings which are required by the collaborative design approach.

These breaks have to be organized in the advance, possibly together with the writing of the session **schedule/timing**. So the team is going to be as **tidy** and **coordinated** as possibile.
