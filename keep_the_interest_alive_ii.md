# Keep the interest alive - Part II

FEEDBACKS - UPDATES

#### **// Description**

Congratulation! If you are reading this last tip you have arrived at one **great point** for your participatory design, but there is still something else to do. 

A complete co-design experience needs also a "**post-phase**", that we called "[Recognition](Our_experience_in_co-design_filed.md#recognition-phase) Phase", which requires a **strict maintenance** and an **organizational capability**.  

As **before** the actual co-design sessions (during which people get their hands dirty) there is, most of the time, a *determined strategy* in engaging and involving people by means of meetings, newsletter, exc as **after** the co-design sessions there should be an *ambitious strategy* as well. 

This strategy can be handled in various ways and through different tools, but it always has a specific goal: making people aware about the **project updates** by receiving and exchanging feedbacks. 

The tools might be the same of those used for the involvement of the communities, but, obviously the informations are going to change in the *layout* and in the *content*. The new informations should be still interesting and able to p**rovoke the curiosity** of the people. 

###### See [Keep the interest alive - Part I](keep_the_interest_alive.md) tip for more details about the different involving online channels.

#### **// In other words**

* **Don't lose the contact** with the participants

* **Keep them involved** even after the sessions

* **Show them the results**, **exchange feedbacks** and keep them **up to date** about the past sessions and the further project

* **Make a list** about the **new ways** and **tools** that you want to use in this phase

* Be **captivating**, spontaneous and clear

* **Schedule** a timetable.

#### **// opencare experience**

After our two co-design sessions, we tried to **not lose the contact** with the participants, who were very interested and *enthusiastic* about the co-design experience. So, first of all, we decided to organize a third meeting **after few days** from the second session. This because we found out that after two evenings of **great workout** a more **relaxing and sharing time** is the least we could do to **appreciate their efforts.**  

This meeting was totally different from the previous two collaborative and productive sessions, it was more like an **aperitif** open to *discussions* and **prompt feedbacks**. 

We showed the participants 

**Aperitif **- June 1st, 2016

The last meeting with the communities was totally different from the previous two collaborative sessions. This one was more an **aperitif**, during which the **atmosphere** was very **relaxing** and enjoyable. But it is not all, there was even such a kind of "**tension**" between participants, because they knew that during this last meeting we were going to state the project that will be *prototype* in the next month. It was very funny! Even if some of them were a bit sad when they heard that their project wasn't choosen. Moreover, we didn't talk just abut the result of the co-design sessions, actually during the presentation, we showed them how we analized and select the final project. Accordingly to our *train of thought*, we explained our selection process, illustrating the evaluation matrix and all the other related tools, with **trasparency** and **clarity**.
