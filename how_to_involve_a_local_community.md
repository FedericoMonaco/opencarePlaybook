Why is a workshop good for the community?
- it makes people share an experience in a informal way, creating a space of trust and making them feeling less isolated as a result
- it makes people collaborate to solve concrete problems
- it makes people feel empowered when facing again at issues in their everyday life

Why is a workshop good for you?
- it creates trust in you by the community
- it makes the people in the community understand the limits of what you are planning to do
- it gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project
- people might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project

### General notes

If your project is inspired by an idea that helps your local community, make sure your emphasis the fact that it can help solve a problem or create opportunities in your local community.
1. **Language:** Make sure your communicate in languages that are understandable by your local community
2. **Relate to your community problems**, present your project from the scope of the local community
If you are replicating/localizing an existing global project make sure your localize your materials to make it easy to involve your local community.
**3.Understand your local community: ** Spend time understanding why they are interested in your project.  Make sure you engage them in the scope they are interested in, for example: A geek who wants to tinker has a different interest from a person who wants to eventually use your project/product
