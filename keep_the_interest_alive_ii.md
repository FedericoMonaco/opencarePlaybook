FEEDBACKS - UPDATES

#### **// Description**

Congratulation! If you are reading this last tip you have arrived at one **great point** for your participatory design, but there is still something else to do. 

A complete co-design experience needs also a "**post-phase**", that we called "[Recognition](Our_experience_in_co-design_filed.md#recognition-phase) Phase", which requires a **strict maintenance** and an **organizational capability**.  

As **before** the actual co-design sessions (during which people get their hands dirty) there is, most of the time, a *determined strategy* in engaging and involving people by means of meetings, newsletter, exc as **after** the co-design sessions there should be a *ambitious strategy* as well. 

This strategy can be handled in various ways and through different tools, but it always has a specific goal: making people aware about the **project updates** by receiving and exchanging feedbacks. 



#### **// In other words**

* **Don't lose the contact** with the participants
* **Make a list** about the **ways** and **tools** that you want to use for informing and keeping up people 
* **Schedule** a timetable
*  

#### **// opencare experience**

*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.
