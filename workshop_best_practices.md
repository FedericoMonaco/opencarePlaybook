# Workshop best practices

According to our experience in organizing and running workshops we have found some issues and best practices that we would like to share to make everyone's like easier. Actually they are also useful as a checklist and reminder whenever you find yourself in the work of setting up a workshop.

Please find here quick links to the most common issues:
- [Space](#space)
- [Material](#material)
- [Coaches](#coaches)
- [Communication](#communication)

### Space
There is no right or wrong space for a workshop, and usually a space can be finetuned to meet diverse needs. One thing for sure, **it's very important to make participants feel comfortable and give them a warm welcome**.
You can use the space in many different ways according to the topic and the methodologies of your workshop. In general when setting up hardware prototyping, digital fabrication and design workshops we have found these practices very helpful:

***Showing digital content -*** if you are planning to project slides and/or show digital content, be sure you have access to a projector and the correct cables and adapters *(if words like VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort are unknown to you, then you might need to check this list before you start [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_connectors)).*

|TIPS|
|-----|
|Prepare the material you want to show in a file format that is widely available and easily sharable. This is important in case you are not able to use your computer and you might need to use another computer to project your content. We have found **PDF files and Google Slides (when internet is available) are good ways to avoid file format issues**.|
|**Be sure your material will fit the resolution supported by the projector**. If you are showing text you want people to be able to read it!|
|As far as it may sound silly, **it's always a good idea to find a good surface (preferably plain and white) to project to, the size of it being big enough so that everyone in the room can see/read**. You only find out how disappointing it is to try to follow someone's speech referring to a slide when you can't see it, when you are attending such a workshop, and not when you are running it!|
|Last but not least, always try to be sure **the ratio between the brightness of the projector and the amount of light in the space is good enough so that everyone can see what you are projecting**. If your space is indoor and you can block sunlight with curtains, then you can probably rely on a cheap projector. If you are planning to project outdoor in the sunlight you might probably need a professional projector. *Please refer to this brief overview to understand more about ANSI lumens, the unit that measures your projector light output power [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_projector#Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_projector#Overview)*| 


***Sitting VS standing -***
Plan in advance to have enough tables and chairs if the participants will need some kind of support plane to work on.

Also, if your workshop requires participants to stand up it's still a good idea to have some chairs in case it last long or you have someone in the crowd who cannot stand up for long.

|TIPS|
|-|
|If you are setting up a workshop where participants will work with hardware it's a good idea to have big tables and to reserve at least one square meter to any of the participants if they are working on their own, or bigger if they are working in groups.|

***Computers -***
If you are planning a workshop that will require participants to work on their laptop (very common in technology oriented sessions) don't forget to find a way to provide them with power, you can assume their laptop batteries will last long enough.

|TIPS|
|-|
|Power plugs, extension cords and multi-outlets are a must need when participants need to use laptops or powered devices without batteries. **Rule of thumb here is "always bring one more"!**|

***Internet -***
Access to a WiFi network can also be considered a must have (apart from sessions where it is requested to avoid using the Internet, are there any?). 

In case access to the Internet is fundamental to run the workshop (say for instance you are planning a workshop on Internet of Things tools), then please be sure to be ready with a plan B if the WiFi is not reliable.

|TIPS|
|-|
|Always be sure to bring: ethernet cables + an access point you can quickly configure + bring a GSM modem for worst case scenarios|


### Material
The kind of material you might need to run your workshop can vary a lot depending on the topic and the methodology. One thing is for sure, **access to the right material is fundamental for a successful workshop**. Not providing participants with the right materials and tools will leave them feeling powerless and might highly compromise their learning process or creative flow.

|TIPS|
|-|
|If you are running the workshop plan your BOM (Bill Of Material) in advance so you are sure you can deal with out of stock items. The best approach is to gather the money needed to acquire the material before the workshop and to buy it on your own, so that you are sure the participants can work with the material you have planned. When this is not possible compile a list with very precise info on where to get the goods so that the person responsible to buy it or the participants themselves won't struggle to find what's needed to attend workshop.|
|If someone else is running the workshop you are responsible for, ask them to send you a detailed BOM asap.|
|Whatever topic your workshop is about it's always a good idea to have at least a small amount of office supplies: paper, markers, pencils, scissors, post-its... They will be useful for participants to take notes or sketch ideas|
|**Never underestimate the importance of tools, always bring more tools then you think you might need!** This is highly topic and methodology independent and will save your life when in need of that small screwdriver or micro USB cable or red marker...|

### Coaches
Who's gonna run the workshop? Are you running it? Are you sure you won't need help from someone else when having to jump from participants to participants asking you questions like there's no tomorrow? Are you sure you can deal with the amount of participants attending the workshop?
These are the kind of questions you should ask yourself when setting up a workshop. They will help you decide the maximum number of participants, and they will make you understand how many coaches are needed to run the workshop successfully.

Finding out how many coaches are needed for a workshop is not an easy job. It might depend on the kind of workshop, on the methodology, and the way you want the participants to feel about the workshop and their learning progress. For instance, [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) (an organization offering free coding workshops) always try to have one coach every four participants.

|TIPS|
|-|
|**In our experience with workshops we have found out that a coach alone can hardly deal with more than 10-12 participants when they are working in groups in hands-on session**. A different story is a lecture-style front-of-the-classroom kind of session, where one coach can deal with a larger number of participants (and the discriminating factor tends more towards the availability of the right technology to reach them all rather than the ability to fix their own peculiar issues)|

Where can you find coaches? Sometimes it might feel hard to find specialized people willing to share what they know, mostly when you don't have a big budget to hire freelance professionals. It is also true that this could compromise the pace of the project, and becoming a turn-down in the people involved. There are some tips that can help you overcome the problem.

|TIPS|
|-|
|**The first place to start looking for coaches is probably always your community** - if people in your community got interested in the project it's very likely that they work in field that has some connections, or they started to learn on their own, or maybe they know someone in the field.|

professionals VS academics
hands-on approach
be respectful
### Communication
