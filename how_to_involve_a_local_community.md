- it makes people collaborate to solve concrete problems
- it makes people feel empowered when facing again at issues in their everyday life

Why is a workshop good for you?
- it creates trust in you by the community
- it makes the people in the community understand the limits of what you are planning to do
- it gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project
- people might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project
