# How can I structure a co-design session? [Silvia and Chiara]


### Introduction

#### 1) How is this chapter structured?

The aim of this chapter is to produce a general but at the same time complete overview on participatory design activities.
In the **Introduction** we will provide the methodology, we will explain the details and we will show you how we have applied the theory to a practical/real life example.

(Beware: all the theoretical information is fundamental, especially if this is the first time that you are bumping into the co-design world.)

Therefore, first of all you will have the possibility to understand **What is a co-design session**, by reading its **Definition** and reflecting on its real meaning.
Once you will have got the essence of the topic, you can read throughout the different **Characteristics** of the collaborative design discipline.
We will then complete the methodological section by listing the different and peculiar **Typologies and approaches** of co-design.

In order to make you understand in an efficient way the theory we will move to a practical example, **Our experience in co-design field**. In this subchapter we will introduce our tangible experience and right after it we will explain the reason **Why we organized a co-design session**.

Once you will have completed the Introduction you will have a basic knowledge of collaborative design activity.

This may be enough for you, but in case your aim is to organize and develop a participatory design session, we warmly suggest you to keep reading the **Tips**.
These are pieces of cakes, simple rules that, if correctly followed, can allow you to achieve your goal in the most efficient way.

Each Tip will be divided in two: a general/theoretical description and a practical example related to our co-design experience.

In the end, in order to sum up all the contents mentioned above, we will provide a **Survival table of contents for a co-design session**, based on our **opencare** experience.

### Tips

####Introduction:
If you have decided to keep on reading until here and further, then it means that you really want to test yourself and structure a co-design session (or you are just very curious and thirsty for knowledge, which is also great and well accepted).
Below you are going to find 9 tips, each one is structured as it follows:

####- Title
(simple rule-to-follow) // KEYWORDS (regarding the contents)

- **Description** (explanation of the rule)

- **In other words** (summarized elements and topics that you need to pay attention to)
- **opencare experience** (tip applied to our real experience in the **opencare** project, with pictures and comments related to the topic)

The aim of this core section is to give you information and proper knowledge in order to **get familiar** with the **strategic design **and emphatic activities.
Please, always keep in mind that collaborative design is not an **exact science**, and that every single element may vary depending on a number of factors. Take this as an **inspiration tool**, as a starting point, and then **jump** into the discipline, start testing, experiment, fail and then try again. Only in this way you will find the proper way to accomplish your real goals.
And remember: **have fun**!

####- Pay attention to the context // VARIETY - TONE OF VOICE - LANGUAGE
- **Description**

One of the first things that you need to understand is the **type of community** that you are involving or willing to involve.
###### In order to understand how to involve a local community, please check the chapter “How to involve citizens in a local community?”
If you decided to structure a co-design session it means that you have an aim, a strong reason; whether you are trying to **gather information** about a specific topic, or you are willing to **improve** the characteristics of your product/service with the help of your customers, or again you want to find an **innovative solution** to an identified problem, you need to **involve** a community of people.
Understanding your community is one of the first fundamental steps, because according to it you will have to **shape your tone of voice**.

Some people, for instance, may not understand technical terms on which your research is based on.
In this case you may want to choose one of the following options: **simplify** your language; **explain** during the process the meaning of those terms; **prepare** your audience in advance, giving them the possibility to face the reality they will have to jump into.
Therefore, if you are leading a research project you may have to work with people that are not necessarily experts/specialists, and that may have difficulties to understand the general context, if your language is too structured.

Another element you need to be careful about is the **delicacy** of the topic you are working on.
If you are willing to involve people in an activity that partly violates their **privacy**, or that regards personal information, you need to let them know in advance and we suggest you to be careful about the terms/activities you may want to use. It is important to protect them first, and then yourself, by being transparent with them about the use of the data and about sensitive information.

Lastly, consider the possibility of having a **various audience**. In this case you will have to adjust the tone of voice and activities in order to make every participant at the same level (if this is your aim, obviously). Remember that the aim of the collaborative design activity that you are structuring has to **be clear** to every single attendee, therefore your explanations will have to be structured in order to be understood by all of them.

- **In other words**

// **Modulate** your tone of voice according to your audience

// Make the aim and structure of the activity **clear** and** understandable**

// Pay attention to the **privacy** of participants and sensibility of the topic

// Evaluate the **variety **of the participants and shape your tone of voice accordingly

- **opencare experience**

During the definition of our co-design session we had to take into account a number of elements and characteristics that were crucial in order to obtain a successful activity.
First of all we had to relate with **various communities** and groups of people, characterized by **different ages** and **life experiences**.
Since we are talking about our **local experience**, it is important to underline that the main language we used was Italian. Some words, however, were written and pronounced in English (first among everything the title of the project: **opencare**). This was one of the main obstacles that we encountered, because some participants didn’t know the **foreign language**, therefore they had problems with understanding the meaning.

Another obstacle was related to the **complexity of terms** that are daily used in fablab/makerspace environments, but rarely in common situations.
In order to fix this problem on the one hand we **simplified** the language, on the other hand we organized some meetings and workshop with the aim of making the participants **get close **to the technologies and terminologies relevant for us.

Lastly, **privacy** has been a pressing issue for us.
Since **opencare** co-design session regarded personal stories related with **health** and **social care**, we clearly talked with the communities involved and pointed out that their stories would have been anonymously published on our online platform EdgeRyders, and that we would have recorded the activity itself with microphones and cameras. Those people who agreed signed a paper which stated that they had been informed and that they accepted to share all the generated content.
In this way we managed to protect both parties.

####- Point out the desired outcomes // GOALS
* **Description**

After understanding the context you are going to operate into it is time for you to think about the reason why you decided to structure this activity and the **deliverables** that you want to get once it will be finished.
This is an important step, because it will allow you to define the activities and the actions to undertake from now on.

If you will not define all the desired outcomes in a proper and satisfying way you may risk to end up with **nothing in your hands** (we know, it sounds like a dramatic sentence but it is more real than you can imagine).

Therefore try to answer to the following questions in the most detailed way:

* Why is a co-design session a **useful tool** for me?

* Who do I want to **involve**?

* What **kind of involvement** will I require from them?

* Why are these groups/communities/people important for the **achievement**?

* What do I want to **learn** from them and with them?

* What kind of materials do I necessarily need in order to **proceed with the work** after the session?


* Will I need any **visual** material?

* Will I need any **written** material?

* exc.

These are just some of the possible questions that you may try to answer. Some questions may not be useful in your specific case, some others may be crucial. The most important thing is ending up this phase with a **detailed list of outcomes**.

- **In other words**

// Ask yourself in detail what kind of **deliverable** you expect obtaining

// Write down the **answers** in order to refer to them at any time

// Make a list of your **essential goals**

- **opencare experience**

WeMake’s role inside the opencare project was, and is, mainly related with **collecting experiences** of community-driven care services.

The collection of experiences, however, is a previous step to another important action that we have to accomplish, which is the creation of one or more **prototypes**, based on the needs/solutions identified with the communities.
The development of the prototype was indeed a **steady focus point** in the editing of the list of outcomes.

Here you can see ours, that was later enhanced once we defined better our tools:

(our deliverables picture)

---
####- Define the elements/features // MODERATOR ROLES DATES
*establish the length, the number of sessions, the place, exc (nota bene...)*

---
- Find the right tools // CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 
*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))* - give an explanation to each tool

####- Keep the interest alive // WEBSITE - LANDING PAGE - NEWSLETTER - BLOGPOST
- **Description**

Once you have defined which kind of **communities** and **people** you are going to **collaborate** with, you are ready to start improving and enhancing the **relation** between your staff and your further participants. Obviously, there are plenty ways to engage and contact people, but keep in mind that the two main strategies, the online and offline one, are complementary since both of them are not totally efficient. One requires the other one and vice versa. In this tip we are going to talk about the **online channels** that we used to get more in touch with people. 

######*(if you want to know more about the offline activities please see “How to involve citizens in a local community” chapter)*

So, moving on, thanks to the new technologies, there are now many tools available to create links and connections between people. Moreover, there are plenty of channels given by the **global network**, such as: social networks, newsletters, blogs, forums, websites, exc. It is mandatory to choose the **right channels** in order to set up the right basis for a collaborative design approach. The choice mainly depends on which kind of informations you want to spread through those channels and to whom. 

Here some examples of the current *online* channels: 

* **Website**: it allows the final target to get the **most important informations** about the project. It must be as more clear, *functional* and understandable as possible. 
* Social networks: like “Facebook”, “Twitter”, “Google+”, “YouTube”, “Instagram” and so on. They are all different, but all of them lead to the same purpose which is to make a **large number of people** (even with different age) aware about some **imminent topics**. They must be updated continuously. 
* **Newsletter**: it can have different goals, like sending some discounts, updates, invitations to an event, exc. Be careful! It requires a *mailing list* and it must contain an interesting and winsome topic, otherwise it will be considered as **spam** and binned immediately. 
* **Blog**: it allows people to have an unfading **database** of informations and past events. It can be like a *diary* or a list of occurrences. There should be the possibility to leave a **comment** in order to allow people to start a discussion about a specific topic. It must be tidy, in other words, the staff must pay meticulous attention to organize all the posts and stories, they should be divided into categories by tags, dates, places, actors, keywords, exc. 
* **Forum**: as all the other online channels explained above, also the forum requires continuous *maintenance*. Maybe more than the other ones. It allows people to *discuss* about various topics, but still it is a perfect place to make **questions** and receive **replies** from both experts and principiants. This last point may be considered both a pros and cons, since the forum visitor can reach the accurate information required. It must have, especially at the beginning, some “**moderators**” who have to manage and oversee all the discussions. 

Try to answer to the following questions, they may give you the starting point which are useful to define your best online strategy:

* Which kind of **informations** do I want to spread?
* **Who** do I want to contact/inform/invite/...?
* Which is the **best channel** for my "target"?
* Does (Facebook) **fulfill** my purposes?
* How (Google+) can **contribute** to my project? 
* exc.

After choosing all these **key factors**, keep in mind that a pipeline will be more than appreciated. It is almost necessary to organize the releases in a strict **schedule** since it will make your staff able to define the roles and the timelines, who does what and when. It is a bit a time consuming at the beginning, but it will avoid further wasting time. Trust us, it is very helpful!

######*(see “How to involve an online community?” chapter for more details)*

- **In other words**

// Define **who** you want to get more in touch with

// Decide which kind of **informations** do you want to spread 

// Choose in which **channels** do you want to share your infos

// **Schedule** a pipeline of the content releases. 

- **opencare experience**

Since the beginning of our co-design experience, we have had to create a **solid online strategy**. Not only to involve the current online communities but even for bringing new local communities into it. We had to design and adapt all the contents, from time to time, to new channels according to the different phases of the co-design. In these last six months of activities we moved through two main parallel directions, one based on the **engagement** and the other one based on the aim to provide a **basic knowledge** about **opencare** project. 

So, first of all, we engaged people by means of **invitations** and **general posts** shared on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube), emails and our **blog**. 

(picture “OC-blogpost”)

Then we found out that an appropriate **basic knowledge** was necessary in order to have an efficient co-design with citizens, so we started to revise and re-design the **opencare website** and its **landing page**. 

(picture “OC-landingpage-01/02”)

But that is far from enough, we started sending a **newsletter** about some projects that might be useful for gaining a **first approach** and a **better understanding** of the wide world of open source products and services for care. In these newsletters we used colloquial words and expressions in a *three-questions template*. This because, since our “target” was mainly composed by “no-tinkerer people”, we wanted to make those projects as more comprehensible as possible to them. We wanted to **arouse curiosity** but at the same time we wanted to **make people feel valuable**. At the end of the newsletter we always put our *contacts*, and sometimes the invitation for a specific event (the two co-design sessions, some other workshops, exc).

####- Don’t underestimate the details // COORDINATION - DAY SCHEDULE - APPS
- **Description**

As you can see in the previous tips, a **coordinated team** is mandatory during each co-design phase. The team must always to be able to communicate in the easier and most effective way. Moreover, the current design approach is requiring more and more kind of collaborations between people from different cities and/or even countries, and a **tidy coordination** would be a great help. 

There are a lot of **digital applications** that enable all the team members to collaborate even in remote working. These applications are not just useful to communicate, but they are also perfect in **organizing** the *timetables*, dividing the *roles*, accomplish the *tasks*, and so on.

So, try to not be afraid about these “innovative” apps that use up your *gigabytes*, infact they are designed for helping you in not underestimate the details of an entire project. Search for the best one for you, try and test it with your project managers and then share it with the rest of the team. You should trust in these apps. But if you prefer mostly the traditional tools, we recommend you to take a piece of paper and write down the classical “**To do list**” (explaining who-when-how) in order to not forget anything. 

- **In other words**

// Look for **new tools** that help you in organizing your and others’ work

// **Try and test** these apps with your project managers and then **share** them with all the team

// Make the **communication** and the **collaboration** between all your team members easy and effective

// Write down all the **tasks and roles** of a specific project, dividing them in a **timetable**

// Handle and hold the team as more **coordinated** as possible.

- **opencare experience**

In our experience, we have tested and used a lot of applications, mainly both for smartphone and laptop. Here there is a **list of some tools** that we are still using, keep in mind that it is not a promotion work, it is just a sharing of our successes and failures: 

* **Slack**: we use it to *communicate* to each other. It is very useful because it allows us to organize **different chat channels** according to the key sections of the main project. Within its pros, there is the fact that it is possible to create **bots**, which can send specific *notification* even from other applications. 
* **Hangout**: at the moment it is the best app to make sync and **video call**. It is especially recommended for *remote working*. It has also a chat window that allows the members to share and type *external links*. 
* **Google documents**: thanks to **Google Drive**, we are able to share and manage a huge amount of folders and file. We use **Google applications** mostly for everything, from typing a *meeting minutes* to organize a *co-design session*. Therefore we use them as parallel support of other applications. 
* **Asana**: it is very useful but at the same time it is a bit time consuming, especially at the beginning. But after a while it creates such a kind of *dependence*. It allows people to organize their own **tasks** but even to assignee some tasks to others. Surely, the strength point of this app is that everyone can see and check others’ tasks and set them according to a specific **deadline**. It has still some cons, but we are sure that Asana will be improved. 
* **EventBrite**: it is not the first time that we use EventBrite. It is very useful when you have to **organize an event** and you have to invite many people. It is a functional way to have an immediate feedback on who did the registration and who didn’t. But it is not just useful in preparing the event, it is very effective during the **check-in** too. It is a fast way to know is someone will show up in the event. 

Obviously, you have to keep in mind that most of the time not all the registered people will show up in your great event! Then you have to be prepared to extemporize. But just to not be totally lost in this situation it might be very useful, especially a co-design session, a **timing sheet** about who does what, how and when. Of course, it should be written and showed to all the staff members before any kind of event, well in advance and preferably in a relaxed way.

####- Be clear and complete about the project/meeting/outcomes // CLARITY - OPEN TRANSPARENCY
- **Description**

*explain clearly the roles, schedule of activities, project characteristics, goals, and answer in a complete way to every question/doubt of participants*



---

- Have fun but don't lose the focus // REWARD - BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE
*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement (in very step of the session - presentation, team work, break), but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*

- Keep the interest alive II // FEEDBACKS - UPDATES
*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.
