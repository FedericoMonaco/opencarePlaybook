# How can I structure a co-design session? [Silvia and Chiara]


### Introduction

#### 1) How is this chapter structured?

The aim of this chapter is to produce a general but at the same time complete overview on participatory design activities.
In the **Introduction** we will provide the methodology, we will explain the details and we will show you how we have applied the theory to a practical/real life example.

(Beware: all the theoretical information is fundamental, especially if this is the first time that you are bumping into the co-design world.)

Therefore, first of all you will have the possibility to understand **What is a co-design session**, by reading its **Definition** and reflecting on its real meaning.
Once you will have got the essence of the topic, you can read throughout the different **Characteristics** of the collaborative design discipline.
We will then complete the methodological section by listing the different and peculiar **Typologies and approaches** of co-design.

In order to make you understand in an efficient way the theory we will move to a practical example, **Our experience in co-design field**. In this subchapter we will introduce our tangible experience and right after it we will explain the reason **Why and how we organized a co-design session**.

Once you will have completed the Introduction you will have a basic knowledge of collaborative design activity.

This may be enough for you, but in case your aim is to organize and develop a participatory design session, we warmly suggest you to keep reading the **Tips**.
These are pieces of cakes, simple rules that, if correctly followed, can allow you to achieve your goal in the most efficient way.

Each Tip will be divided in two: a general/theoretical description and a practical example related to our co-design experience.

In the end, in order to sum up all the contents mentioned above, we will provide a **Survival table of contents for a co-design session**, based on our **opencare** experience.

#### 2) What is a co-design session?
####// Definition
As we can read in the research essay *The Dynamics of Collaborative Design *(written by specialists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New England Complex Systems Institute):

*Collaborative design is performed by multiple participants (representing individuals, teams or even entire organizations), each potentially capable of proposing values for design issues and/or evaluating these choices from their own particular perspective.*
[http://necsi.edu/research/engineering/ceraj-02.pdf]

Therefore we understand that in this participatory act all the different actors try to move through an **innovation process**. Every person has the potential and the capability of exploring and defining problems, as well as focusing on solutions and evaluations.

The design process can be defined collaborative when the closed and hierarchical mechanism is replaced by an **open** and **flat** one, taking distance from the exclusivity of designers, researchers and developers, in order to involve some or all the people that the research is directly or indirectly concerning.

####// Characteristics
A complete collaborative process, however, is characterized by an alternation of moments, which can be close/open and hierarchical/flat. Even though participative activities are meant to be open and extended, the core and substantial decisions have to been taken by the research/design/development team since they may require tighter control in order to meet the project deliverable.

Therefore we will have different steps (referred to a standardized co-design process):
- **Discover** (closed and flat): a chosen group shares ideas and contributes together
- **Define** (closed and hierarchical): an authority decides which idea will be further developed
- **Develop** (open and flat): anyone can contribute to the innovation process
- **Deliver** (open and hierarchical): anyone can contribute but the final decision about the project to deliver is in the hands of the person/company/organization in charge.

We can state that a phase of a project can be:
- **open**, when the subject area is not well defined;
- **closed**, when the subject area is well defined and it is possible to determine the most appropriate contributors for the project;

In addition, the governance of collaboration, in order to be successful, requires the participants to agree on same goals (**flat**), or have their own goals within the hierarchy (**hierarchical**).

####// Typologies/approaches
Generally speaking, we can distinguish two different types of **approach**, which are characterized by different levels of innovation and exploration:

#####A “passive” approach
*Co-design is often used by trained designers who recognize the difficulty in properly understanding the cultural, societal, or usage scenarios encountered by their user.* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#Co-design]

This is more similar to the “classic” design thinking approach: the designer approaches the user trying to understand better the issues and to observe the user to gain more insights about the user environment. It follows a rework of the notes by the designer, a brainstorm for solutions, and only then proposing possible solutions to the user. After this phase the iterative process comes into play feeding back the idea with test results, coming to the best possible deliverable (for the user and the designer as well).

#####An “active” approach
*[...] the key attribute of participatory design, a process which allows multiple voices to be heard and involved in the design, resulting in outcomes which suite a wider range of users. As planning affects everyone it is believed that ‘those whose livelihoods, environments and lives are at stake should be involved in the decisions which affect them.*
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#Community_planning_and_placemaking]

This approach is probably harder to implement when compared to the “classic” design thinking approach. It involves a concentrated activity where any of the involved actors can share and discuss their problems (and solution in some cases) and understand the other participants’ point of view.
A moderated collective discussion will follow trying to shape the stream of thoughts into deliverables for the start of the prototyping session. The participants will be involved in the user testing session(s) and possibly in the prototyping phase as well.

These two approaches are trying to cluster a number of shades that, unfortunately, it is impossible to explode and analyze here one by one.
You may want to commit yourself to participatory activities because you want to **differentiate** your product from competitors’ invention; or because you want to develop **new solutions**, drastically different and powerfully innovated; or still because you want to **implement** a project; or just because you want to **experiment**, learn or stimulate creativity.

Whatever your reason is going to be, always keep in mind that collaborative design has 4 main potentials:
- **participation** (it empowers the user to create innovation);
- **inspiration** (it manages to stimulate creativity of designers);
- **information** (it is useful to frame challenges);
-  **dialogue** (it is a powerful way to create a conversation among organizations and not only).

Keep in mind: there is no one-size-fits-all rule regarding collaborative design: every characteristic may change according to different aspects, such as aim, motivation, problem, context, exc.
Even though following subchapters will regard the specific situation of **opencare**, we will try to provide some general tips that will help you shaping your sessions accordingly.

#### 3) Our experience in co-design field

Since January 2016, thanks to **opencare**, we had the great opportunity to launch and spread a two-year research project, aiming to design and prototype new care services in Milan, Italy.

As **WeMake**, we are going to approach different challenges, such as:
					
* collect experiences of community-driven care services;
* validate them through open discussion, both online and offline;
* augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking...);
* combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services. 

How are we going to face them? Easy, by using a so-called **strategic design** approach. 

During the last **six months** we organized and divided our **timetable** into four main phases: 

1. **Inspiration** phase; 
2. **Ideation** phase;
3. **Implementation** phase;
4. **Recognition** phase. 

####// Inspiration phase

During this first step, we did a lot of research at the same time both online and offline. On one hand, we searched for the most popular **methodologies** and **strategies** used and known in **co-design discipline**, in order to build a general background material and information about what is alredy done and what can be customized for our specific experience; on the other hand we organized, thanks also to the **Municipality of Milan**, a lot of **meetings, workshops **and **events** in order to engage and reach many *qualitative* people as possibile. It gave us the possibilty have face-to-face meetings and to get in touch with different kind of **citizens** and their **communities**.

######*(see "How to involve a local community" chapter for more details)*

~~Here, there is a list of all the **meetings/workshops/events** that we holded with local communities:~~

![](http://wemake.cc/core/uploads/2016/04/OC-Opencare_incontri_informagiovani.png)

~~Our **second workshop** organized by WeMake and the Municipality of Milan at Forum delle Politiche Sociali. During this workshop, the participants were divided in different two-people groups. They were asked to idealize and **prototype**, in just few hours, an opensource remote monitoring and caring IoT service.~~

~~**7. Social Street San Gottardo - April 19th, 2016  ** // meeting~~

![](http://wemake.cc/core/uploads/2016/04/OC-Opencare_incontri_socialstreet.png)

~~Last but not least, we had a meeting with the community named Social Street San Gottardo, a community of **citizens** who decided to live the neighborhood by re-activating and improving the social relationships towards a better liveability through exchange initiatives, entertainment and education. The meeting was holded in Corso San Gottardo 41, Milan.~~

####// Ideation Phase

Once we had identified the communities, we defined what kind of **communication** and **interactions** we want to test in the next phases and, according to them, we designed **new tools** and **materials**. 

######*(see "Tips" subchapter for more details)*

####// Implementation Phase

It is time now to test and use in real time the tools and the schedule that we designed for our **first co-design experience**. During the two co-design sessions, we have the possibility to dialogue and work with people from many different Milanese communities and with different interests, issues and needs. For example, some of them were interested in caring and **everyday well-being**, others in **tinkering stuff** and, still, others in more **health issues**.

Our aim was to create a **temporary community** composed by different kind of citizens. So, we decided to divide the co-design in two main sessions (May 4th - 11th, 2016) 




 from many different Milanese communities, making them feel active participants, asking and listening their issues and needs - *don't be afraid to get your hands dirty!*



During these encounters, our **stuff** had to perform various tasks and **roles** according to the different situations. For example, we had to manage and set the speech every time according to the audience (once composed by elderly people and another one composed by tinkerer or new comers), we had to provide tools, assistance and **specific capabilities** during the workshops or we had to fulfill such a kind of **mentor role** during the co-design session by means of supporting the participants and their group talking.  

We always must to take into account the **emphatic approach**, since it allows us to gain a better understanding about other people's feelings, emotions, needs, exc. Moreover, we might be able to be **flexible**: once we have to be more like a **teacher**, another time like a **phsycologist** or a **friend**, once more we have just to be a **silent auditor**.

### Tips

- Pay attention to the context // VARIETY - TONE OF VOICE - LANGUAGE
*think about the community you are involving (nota bene...)*

- Point out the desired outcomes // GOALS
*try to understand clearly your goals and what you want to achieve* 

(add situations/aims of Design Probes: find new ways to differentiate a product from competitors' inventions, develop new solutions, implement a project, experiment, learn and stimulate creativity - participation, inspiration, information, dialogue)

- Define the elements/features // MODERATOR ROLES DATES
*establish the length, the number of sessions, the place, exc (nota bene...)*

- Find the right tools // CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 
*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))* - give an explanation to each tool

- Keep the interest alive // NEWSLETTER - BLOGPOSTS
*make the community interested and involved, give them updates and make them feel valuable (explain how we involve/engage people and why, for example: local communities > awareness > newsletter)*

- Don't underestimate the details // DAY SCHEDULE
*schedule in advance team meetings to define the tight schedules of the sessions, keep in mind some relax/free moments be sure that someone will show up*  (talk about EventBrite) https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZQrQnrQbt4luXITNsmfzNd3wNHFqYwmQn8ZcsqRI1U/edit

- Be clear and complete about the project/meeting/outcomes // CLARITY - OPEN TRANSPARENCY
*explain clearly the roles, schedule of activities, project characteristics, goals, and answer in a complete way to every question/doubt of participants*

- Have fun but don't lose the focus // REWARD - BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE
*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement (in very step of the session - presentation, team work, break), but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*

- Keep the interest alive II // FEEDBACKS - UPDATES
*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.
