# Find the right tools

CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 

#### **// Description**
Now you have the **Who** (participants), the **What** (goals), and part of the **How** (elements/features). We need to define the other half of the How, which are the **design tools**.

These are the instruments that you will use to play your **symphony**. You will have to tune them harmoniously and they will help you reaching the goals.
Collaborative design, as you know, is a discipline. And like any other practice it requires the user to **learn**, **discover** and **test** different ways, in order to find the most suitable one.

We have already said before that **this is not an exact science**, therefore it will be impossible for us to suggest you a set of tools that will be perfect for your activity. You will have to dive deep and discover by yourself which one is fitting your requirements at its best.
Don’t worry, we will assist you in this path as much as we can.

Let’s start thinking about what you have so far: Who, What and ½ How. In the previous tip you set the duration and repetition of the activity. Keeping this in mind, you have to find the best way to reach your **desired deliverables**. One way could be sitting around a table and talking with your participants about your project/topic/idea until you have got enough insights/information.
But co-design is much more than this. Therefore we suggest you to take a look at some interesting and useful set of tools, that may be just right for you.

Part of the selection will be **supported by what you have defined so far**: if you have just 2 hours of availability then you are not going to choose a prototyping experience, that may take much longer than that.

A very useful and inspiring set of tools that you can check is the **method cards**. In particular, we suggest you these two toolkits: **[IDEO Method Cards](https://www.ideo.com/work/method-cards)** and **[FROGDESIGN Collective Action Toolkit](http://www.frogdesign.com/work/frog-collective-action-toolkit.html)**.

The first one is a deck of cards that you can purchase online. There are 51 cards, and each card represents one tool. The tools are split in 4 different categories: Learn, Look, Ask, Try, according to your aim.
Furthermore, the tool itself is structured as follows: HOW (description of the action), WHY (reason why you should use it).

Collective Action Toolkit, on the other hand, is a PDF that you can download. As well as the previous one, every tool is split in different categories: Clarify your goal, Build your group, Seek new understanding, Imagine more ideas, Make something real, Plan for action.
The toolkit is very well structured because it suggests simple or more articulated sequences of tools. Every single tool is divided into steps, that will help you structuring the activity. Other aspects are also pointed out, such as Time, Roles and Materials.

These sets of tools will be able to inspire you and to give you the possibility to select properly according to your aim, time, participants, exc.
Design method is a world that needs to be discovered, and that is a great way to start.
Another interesting website, but unfortunately a little bit outdated, is www.servicedesigntools.org. Here you will be able to navigate and explore a variety of methods and connected case studies.

Even though these databases are rich of useful hints and tools, there is the possibility that none of them satisfied completely your needs.
Unfortunately, these kind of situations happen.

In this case we suggest you to get inspired and then try to design your own tools. In order to do that you need to have some knowledge of collaborative design and surely even a little experience.
Secondly, you need to work within a team. Having different competencies is precious, and would become helpful in moments such as this one.
Beware, this way is risky and may imply failure. Don’t be afraid of this, but take your time to experiment and test your tools before the activity.

*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))* - give an explanation to each tool
