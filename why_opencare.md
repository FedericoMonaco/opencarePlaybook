# Why opencare? [Costantino]
For most of humanity’s history, care services – which today we call health and social care – were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other’s children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.
This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people…) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.
What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?

We are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching **opencare**, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:
* collect experiences of community-driven care services
* validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.
* augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking…)
* combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.

WeMake is part of the **opencare** consortium with the following partners:
Edgeryders
Città di Milano
ScimPulse Foundation
The Stockholm School of Economics
Università di Bordeaux

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670


## Where does the idea come from?
*Premise [by Manzini]*

Since the beginning of human history, care has been exchanged (given and received) inside homogeneous, durable and relatively closed groups of individuals: families, clans, village communities, urban neighborhoods...

In the past century, in parallel to that, care has been delivered also by dedicated institutions: hospitals, kindergartens, elderly residences...

Today, for several reasons, the demand of care is growing and becoming more complex, while both the traditional and the modern offer of care are less and less capable to cope with it.
Actually, in the contemporary fluid, hyper individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing) and individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it).

In turn, care institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community and individual care, have less and less economic resources (and often political will) to do it.

The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis: a lack of care that is not only practical (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand), but also psychological (the sense of loneliness deriving by the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society).

To overcome this crisis a brand new care systems has to be imagined and enhanced. To move in this direction, a first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity.

**[Ale] I would also briefly add more details on how the project actually started, that the idea came out at LOTE and how the partners got together**

## What is care?
Aside from being a word that we use regularly, the meaning of "care" might have different interpretations:
[by Manzini]
1. 
*Care referred to a special kind of human interaction*: someone (the care giver) gives attention to, and takes action for, someone else (the care receiver).
2. 
*Care referred to a set of artifacts*: the products and services of the system which, in a given time and place, enables the care activities (i.e. the care interaction of the point 1).

## What is open?
*Open source, open data, open knowledge, open mind...* What exactly is the meaning of "open" in the contemporary world?

A succinct summary from the *Open Definition* website ([http://opendefinition.org/](http://opendefinition.org/)):

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

Starting from this assumption, "open" could gain a more complex meaning within the field of care:
[by Manzini]

* 
A.
*Open referred to the care system:* a system is open when different actors have the possibility to play a role. This can happen when the whole activity package is opened and divided into parts with the possibility, for these different parts, to be distributed among different actors.

* 
B.
*Open referred to the information flow:* a system is open when the information on which it is based are open. This can happen when these information are totally visible, accessible and transferable to other systems.

## What is *opencare* then?
[by Manzini]
Considering the different meanings of “care” and “open” there is a clear correlation between 1 and A, and between 2 and B:
* 
A1.
*Open care refers to the final result.* That is, it refers to the characteristics of the care system we intend to create: a care system where different actors (experts and non experts) are in condition to play a relevant role.

B2.
*Open care refers to the design/production process.* That is, it refers to the characteristics of a co-design and co-production process: the process leading to the realization of the products and services on which an aimed care system is based.
