# How to involve an online community? [Moushira]

## Why an online community?
There is a number of reasons why you would want to consider having an online community for your project.  Not only doest it broaden the aspects of your projects and collaborators but it also allows room for different experiences and levels of tech expertise to be invlved in your project. The level of involvement of your online community depends on the stage of your project. An esablished project with existing team, that seeks replicators, would need a different strategy from a starting project that is seeking team members. In the scenario below, we assume that you have a very small team on the ground and that the project is at a very early stage of development.

###Where to target?
Building an online project portfolio is your step one to reach out to your online audiance.  You can choose a comibination of the below options:
1. A simple landing page with About and team sections.  Where you elaborate on why you are building your project, what problem are you solving, and what resources do you need.
2. An account on one of the documentation platforms. Depending on familirarity and level of comfort, this could be an instrucatbels page or a github manual.
3. Social media accounts. If you have already kicked off some activities on the ground, even if a simple meeting, the you need to announce and document those on your FB and Twitter handle
4. Find your online friends.  Here we don't mean finding people whom you know, but finding accounts and platforms that are aligned with your efforts, target them and ask them for retweet, sharing, collaboration, etc.  When you find a likeminded, make sure you reach out to their audiance.
### How to target?
Now assuming that you have already built one of more of the online foot prints above.  You need to focus on your messaging.  A few hints on this:
1. Make sure you highlight the WHY of your project
2. Tell your full story: Make sure you emphasis the different sides of activities that your project has.  For example, don't put all your focus on the technology side, or the social side. Make sure you tell the full story so that a developer looking for gig can knock your door, at the same time a hobbiyest can contect your to become a beta tester.
3. Don't waste your time.  If a strategy isn't working, if you aren't getting followers and there are no signs of growth after 2 weeks, change your strategy immediatly. 
4. Be responsive. Very responsive to comments inquiries, etc.  
5. Document. Have documentation for whatever stage you are in at your project. You don't have to finish your project to document. You documentation starts on day one.
