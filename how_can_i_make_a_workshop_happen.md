# How can I make a workshop happen?

A hands-on workshop is usually a very good way to engage local communities and to find people interested in the project.
However organizing a workshop is also usually time intensive and requires a lot of effort in terms of research, planning, logistics and communication.

Workshops can be approached in different ways according to the topic and methodology, but there are common issues that we can cover and analyze separately. A compendium of [best practices](workshop_best_practices.md) has been collected to make your life easier!

At the end of the chapter you will also find a [brief summary](our_workshop_experience.md) of our direct experience about organizing workshops for the opencare project. We hope it will help to give you a good place where start.
