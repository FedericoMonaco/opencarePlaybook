# Point out the desired outcomes

GOALS

#### **// Description**

After understanding the context you are going to operate into it is time for you to think about the reason why you decided to structure this activity and the **deliverables** that you want to get once it will be finished.
This is an important step, because it will allow you to define the activities and the actions to undertake from now on.

If you will not define all the desired outcomes in a proper and satisfying way you may risk to end up with **nothing in your hands** (we know, it sounds like a dramatic sentence but it is more real than you can imagine).

Therefore try to answer to the following questions in the most detailed way:

* Why is a co-design session a **useful tool** for me?

* Who do I want to **involve**?

* What **kind of involvement** will I require from them?

* Why are these groups/communities/people important for the **achievement**?

* What do I want to **learn** from them and with them?

* What kind of materials do I necessarily need in order to **proceed with the work** after the session?

* Will I need any **visual** material?

* Will I need any **written** material?

* exc.

These are just some of the possible questions that you may try to answer. Some questions may not be useful in your specific case, some others may be crucial. The most important thing is ending up this phase with a **detailed list of outcomes**.

#### **// In other words**

* Ask yourself in detail what kind of **deliverable** you expect obtaining

* Write down the **answers** in order to refer to them at any time

* Make a list of your **essential goals**

#### **// opencare experience**

WeMakeâ€™s role inside the opencare project was, and is, mainly related with **collecting experiences** of community-driven care services.

The collection of experiences, however, is a previous step to another important action that we have to accomplish, which is the creation of one or more **prototypes**, based on the needs/solutions identified with the communities.
The development of the prototype was indeed a **steady focus point** in the editing of the list of outcomes.

Here you can see ours, that was later enhanced once we defined better our tools:

**Deliverables**

* Detailed brief with:

- - references to user needs
- - and proposed solutions (including the ones that have not been selected)

* Important documents related to the brainstorm session(s):

* * Transcriptions
* * Sketches
* * Flow charts


* A list of possible testers
* Eventually a list of people who will participate in the prototyping phase and the skills that they can bring to the table
