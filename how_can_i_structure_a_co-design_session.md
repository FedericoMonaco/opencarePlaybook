# How can I structure a co-design session? [Silvia and Chiara]


### Introduction

### 1) How is this chapter structured?

The aim of this chapter is to produce a general but at the same time complete overview on participatory design activities.
In the **Introduction** we will provide the methodology, we will explain the details and we will show you how we have applied the theory to a practical/real life example.

(Beware: all the theoretical information is fundamental, especially if this is the first time that you are bumping into the co-design world.)

Therefore, first of all you will have the possibility to understand **What is a co-design session**, by reading its definition and reflecting on its real meaning.
Once you will have got the essence of the topic, you can read throughout the different **Characteristics** of the collaborative design discipline.
We will then complete the methodological section by listing the numerous and peculiar **Typologies and approaches** of co-design.

In order to make you understand in an efficient way the theory we will move to a practical example, **Our co-design session - overview**. In this subchapter we will introduce our tangible experience and right after it we will explain the reason **Why we organized a co-design session**.

Once you will have completed the Introduction you will have a basic knowledge of collaborative design activity.

This may be enough for you, but in case your aim is to organize and develop a participatory design session, we warmly suggest you to keep reading the **Tips**.
These are pieces of cakes, simple rules that, if correctly followed, can allow you to achieve your goal in the most efficient way.

Each Tip will be divided in two: a general/theoretical description and a practical example related to our co-design experience.

In the end, in order to sum up all the contents mentioned above, we will provide a **Survival table of contents for a co-design session**, based on our **opencare** experience.

### Tips

- Pay attention to the context // VARIETY - TONE OF VOICE - LANGUAGE
*think about the community you are involving (nota bene...)*

- Point out the desired outcomes // GOALS
*try to understand clearly your goals and what you want to achieve* 

(add situations/aims of Design Probes: find new ways to differentiate a product from competitors' inventions, develop new solutions, implement a project, experiment, learn and stimulate creativity - participation, inspiration, information, dialogue)

- Define the elements/features // MODERATOR ROLES DATES
*establish the length, the number of sessions, the place, exc (nota bene...)*

- Find the right tools // CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 
*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))* - give an explanation to each tool

- Keep the interest alive // NEWSLETTER - BLOGPOSTS
*make the community interested and involved, give them updates and make them feel valuable (explain how we involve/engage people and why, for example: local communities > awareness > newsletter)*

- Don't underestimate the details // DAY SCHEDULE
*schedule in advance team meetings to define the tight schedules of the sessions, keep in mind some relax/free moments be sure that someone will show up*  (talk about EventBrite) https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZQrQnrQbt4luXITNsmfzNd3wNHFqYwmQn8ZcsqRI1U/edit

- Be clear and complete about the project/meeting/outcomes // CLARITY - OPEN TRANSPARENCY
*explain clearly the roles, schedule of activities, project characteristics, goals, and answer in a complete way to every question/doubt of participants*

- Have fun but don't lose the focus // REWARD - BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE
*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement (in very step of the session - presentation, team work, break), but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*

- Keep the interest alive II // FEEDBACKS - UPDATES
*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.
