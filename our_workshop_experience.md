# Our workshop experience
During our first months of the opencare project we held a series of workshops to help engaging the local community.
We share here our experience with the hope that it will be useful as a starting point to set up more workshops, or as an experience that can replicated somewhere else in future opencare local communities.


### Abstract of the workshop

> **Taking care using open source tools**. During this workshop participants will learn hands-on how to use one of the most common technology methodologies about creating open source care solutions. Plus they will create an IoT monitoring service in just a few hours. In an international setting where citizens' care and healthcare are considered growing social issues and cannot be guaranteed to anyone, opencare tries to find solutions to real life care issues leveraging on the experience and help of local and online communities using innovative, low cost and open source technologies.

### Why the topic?
From day one we wanted to set up a tech oriented workshop for two reasons
1. We wanted to make people understand why a Makerspace is involved in a project related to care and healthcare, and what are the pros of having a maker skillset involved in a such a project.
2. We wanted to make people understand and try with their own hands how easy it is to create technology solutions on their own.
3. The hype and attention from the media around projects based on microcontrollers (Arduino to be more specific) is very high in Italy, where we held the workshops.
  4. plus they give participants a lot of freedom to augment and customize the initial proposed idea.
  5. plus we based the workshop on a lot of previous personal experience on the topic
