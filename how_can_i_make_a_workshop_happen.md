# How can I make a workshop happen? [Alessandro]

A hands-on workshop is usually a very good way to engage local communities and to find people interested in the project.
However organizing a workshop is also usually time intensive and requires a lot of effort in terms of research, planning, logistics and communication.

There are many different kinds of workshops you can offer to the community, but mostly they can be grouped in four main categories:
- Educational workshop
- Ideation workshop
- Experiential workshop
- Innovation workshop

Workshops can be approached in different ways according to the category they belong to, but there are common issues and best practices that we can cover and analyze separately:
### Space
There is no right or wrong space for a workshop, and usually a space can be adjusted to meet diverse needs. One thing for sure, it's very important to make participants feel comfortable and give them a warm welcome.

*Sitting VS standing:*
plan to have enough tables and chairs if the participants will need some kind of support plane to work.

*Computers:*
power plugs, extension cords and multi-outlets are a must when participants need to use laptops or powered devices without batteries. Rule of thumb here is "always bring one more"!

*Internet:*
access to a WiFi network can also be considered a must have, apart from sessions where it is requested to avoid using the Internet
