# How can I structure a co-design session? [Silvia and Chiara]


### Introduction

#### 1) How is this chapter structured?

The aim of this chapter is to produce a general but at the same time complete overview on participatory design activities.
In the **Introduction** we will provide the methodology, we will explain the details and we will show you how we have applied the theory to a practical/real life example.

(Beware: all the theoretical information is fundamental, especially if this is the first time that you are bumping into the co-design world.)

Therefore, first of all you will have the possibility to understand **What is a co-design session**, by reading its **Definition** and reflecting on its real meaning.
Once you will have got the essence of the topic, you can read throughout the different **Characteristics** of the collaborative design discipline.
We will then complete the methodological section by listing the different and peculiar **Typologies and approaches** of co-design.

In order to make you understand in an efficient way the theory we will move to a practical example, **Our experience in co-design field**. In this subchapter we will introduce our tangible experience and right after it we will explain the reason **Why we organized a co-design session**.

Once you will have completed the Introduction you will have a basic knowledge of collaborative design activity.

This may be enough for you, but in case your aim is to organize and develop a participatory design session, we warmly suggest you to keep reading the **Tips**.
These are pieces of cakes, simple rules that, if correctly followed, can allow you to achieve your goal in the most efficient way.

Each Tip will be divided in two: a general/theoretical description and a practical example related to our co-design experience.

In the end, in order to sum up all the contents mentioned above, we will provide a **Survival table of contents for a co-design session**, based on our **opencare** experience.

#### 2) What is a co-design session?

####// Definition
As we can read in the research essay *The Dynamics of Collaborative Design *(written by specialists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New England Complex Systems Institute):

*Collaborative design is performed by multiple participants (representing individuals, teams or even entire organizations), each potentially capable of proposing values for design issues and/or evaluating these choices from their own particular perspective.*
[http://necsi.edu/research/engineering/ceraj-02.pdf]

Therefore we understand that in this participatory act all the different actors try to move through an **innovation process**. Every person has the potential and the capability of exploring and defining problems, as well as focusing on solutions and evaluations.

The design process can be defined collaborative when the closed and hierarchical mechanism is replaced by an **open** and **flat** one, taking distance from the exclusivity of designers, researchers and developers, in order to involve some or all the people that the research is directly or indirectly concerning.

####// Characteristics
A complete collaborative process, however, is characterized by an alternation of moments, which can be close/open and hierarchical/flat. Even though participative activities are meant to be open and extended, the core and substantial decisions have to been taken by the research/design/development team since they may require tighter control in order to meet the project deliverable.

Therefore we will have different steps (referred to a standardized co-design process):
- **Discover** (closed and flat): a chosen group shares ideas and contributes together
- **Define** (closed and hierarchical): an authority decides which idea will be further developed
- **Develop** (open and flat): anyone can contribute to the innovation process
- **Deliver** (open and hierarchical): anyone can contribute but the final decision about the project to deliver is in the hands of the person/company/organization in charge.

We can state that a phase of a project can be:
- **open**, when the subject area is not well defined;
- **closed**, when the subject area is well defined and it is possible to determine the most appropriate contributors for the project;

In addition, the governance of collaboration, in order to be successful, requires the participants to agree on same goals (**flat**), or have their own goals within the hierarchy (**hierarchical**).

[http://www.designingcollaboration.com/]

####// Typologies/approaches
Generally speaking, we can distinguish two different types of **approach**, which are characterized by different levels of innovation and exploration:

#####A “passive” approach
*Co-design is often used by trained designers who recognize the difficulty in properly understanding the cultural, societal, or usage scenarios encountered by their user.* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#Co-design]

This is more similar to the “classic” design thinking approach: the designer approaches the user trying to understand better the issues and to observe the user to gain more insights about the user environment. It follows a rework of the notes by the designer, a brainstorm for solutions, and only then proposing possible solutions to the user. After this phase the iterative process comes into play feeding back the idea with test results, coming to the best possible deliverable (for the user and the designer as well).

#####An “active” approach
*[...] the key attribute of participatory design, a process which allows multiple voices to be heard and involved in the design, resulting in outcomes which suite a wider range of users. As planning affects everyone it is believed that ‘those whose livelihoods, environments and lives are at stake should be involved in the decisions which affect them.*
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#Community_planning_and_placemaking]

This approach is probably harder to implement when compared to the “classic” design thinking approach. It involves a concentrated activity where any of the involved actors can share and discuss their problems (and solution in some cases) and understand the other participants’ point of view.
A moderated collective discussion will follow trying to shape the stream of thoughts into deliverables for the start of the prototyping session. The participants will be involved in the user testing session(s) and possibly in the prototyping phase as well.

These two approaches are trying to cluster a number of shades that, unfortunately, it is impossible to explode and analyze here one by one.
You may want to commit yourself to participatory activities because you want to **differentiate** your product from competitors’ invention; or because you want to develop **new solutions**, drastically different and powerfully innovated; or still because you want to **implement** a project; or just because you want to **experiment**, learn or stimulate creativity.

Whatever your reason is going to be, always keep in mind that collaborative design has 4 main potentials:
- **participation** (it empowers the user to create innovation);
- **inspiration** (it manages to stimulate creativity of designers);
- **information** (it is useful to frame challenges);
-  **dialogue** (it is a powerful way to create a conversation among organizations and not only).

Keep in mind: there is no one-size-fits-all rule regarding collaborative design: every characteristic may change according to different aspects, such as aim, motivation, problem, context, exc.
Even though following subchapters will regard the specific situation of **opencare**, we will try to provide some general tips that will help you shaping your sessions accordingly.

#### 3) Our experience in co-design field

Since January 2016, thanks to **opencare**, we had the great opportunity to launch and spread a two-year research project, aiming to design and prototype new care services in Milan, Italy.

As **WeMake**, we are going to approach different challenges, such as:
					
* collect experiences of community-driven care services;
* validate them through open discussion, both online and offline;
* augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking...);
* combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services. 

How are we going to face them? Easy, by using a so-called **strategic design** approach. 

During the last **six months** we organized and divided our **timetable** into four main phases: 

1. **Inspiration** phase; 
2. **Ideation** phase;
3. **Implementation** phase;
4. **Recognition** phase. 

####// Inspiration phase

During this first step, we did a lot of research at the same time both online and offline. On one hand, we searched for the most popular **methodologies** and **strategies** used and known in **co-design discipline**, in order to build a general background material and information about what is alredy done and what can be customized for our specific experience; on the other hand we organized, thanks also to the **Municipality of Milan**, a lot of **meetings, workshops **and **events** in order to engage and reach many *qualitative* people as possibile. It gave us the possibilty have face-to-face meetings and to get in touch with different kind of **citizens** and their **communities**.

######*(see "How to involve citizen in a local community" chapter for more details)*



####// Ideation Phase

Once we had identified the communities, we defined what kind of **communication** and **interactions** we want to test in the next phases and, according to them, we designed **new tools** and **materials**. 

While we were typing this playbook, we found very useful to distinguish the designed tools into two categories: **passive** and **active** tools. The first ones, are more about the tools used by the **WeMake's staff** in order to show, explain and get in touch with the different audience; the second ones are those tools and materials used by the **participants** during the two co-design sessions. 

######*(see "Tips" and "Survival table of content" subchapters for more details)*

####// Implementation Phase

It is time now to test and use in real time the tools and the schedule designed for our **first co-design experience**. During the two co-design sessions, we had the possibility to dialogue and work with people from many different Milanese communities and with different interests, issues and needs. For example, some of them were interested in caring and **everyday well-being**, others in **tinkering stuff** and, still, others in more **health issues**.

Our aim was to create a **temporary community** composed by different kind of citizens. So, we decided to divide the co-design into **two main sessions** (May 4th and 11th, 2016) lasting maximum **4 hours each** (from 6 pm to 21 pm). This because we wanted to receive as many participants as possibile, since most of the people were parents and/or workers. Moreover, after this two encounters we organized even a last one, a "closing" **aperitif** during which we announced the winner project that will be prototyped in the next month (July), explaining and showing our methods and strategies to the participants. All the sessions were hosted by WeMake.

**1. First co-design session** - May 4th, 2016

During the **first co-design session**, we  hosted altogether 27 participants (15 women and 12 men) divided in 3 groups, which have been pre-formed in order to ensure a balance of genders, age and background. The groups were called “Hammer”, “Pincer”, “Screwdriver”, to evoke object's most common use in a manufacture. Each group was assisted by one **facilitator**, who had to be able to create an environment for effective communication, keeping discussion focused and providing opportunities to all voices to be heard. 

We divided the session into three main parts:

* The first part was very **individual**, each participant was asked to focus on one or at most two practical needs in the sphere of daily care activities;
* The second part was more **collective**, since participants were asked to “validate” their issues/needs through a **group discussion** and choose one for each group;
* Then, the third part was a **plenary session**, in which one member per group were asked to present the concept of the selected need.

After this **teamwork** experience, the Municipality of Milan offered a delicious buffet organized by **(?)**. It gave all the participants and the operational staff the possibility to relax and enjoy the time spent together. 

Audio and video of the meeting has been integrally recorded.

**2. Second co-design session** - May 11th, 2016

During the second meeting, we hosted altogether **(?)** participants. First of all, there was a **tight slide presentation** about:

* a list of the **different issues**, revealed form the first session and divided into three macro-areas;
*  an **explanation** about the **tools** that they were going to use during the session;
*  a **general overview **about the **evaluation matrix** that the staff will use for selecting the project to prototype. 

Then, the participants were divided into three groups according to their interest in one isssue instead of the other ones. Then, the participants were asked to collaborate and work together in order to define better their idea and **concept** through the tools. Obviously, they were supported by the mentor. *Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty!*

As the first session, in this second one there was the **planery session** as well, during which one member per group explained to the other groups its concept. Moreover, the break-time was combined with the teamwork time, since the participants were very into it. 


#### 4) Why we decided to organize a co-design session

Since our first effort in the **opencare** project is to *collect experiences of community-driven care services*, after many researches, we realized that a co-design session would have been perfect to accomplish our main purpose. This because, as explained above in **"What is a co-design session?"** subchapter, collaborative design is an **innovative process** which has all the characteristics useful and necessary for discovering, defining, developing and delivering **new product service systems** realized by means of collaborations between common people and professionals. 

Collaborative design allowed us to get in touch with real people, with real issues and needs. It gave us the possibility to **perform various tasks and roles** according to the different situations. 
We were asked to make people/participants feel active and involved in the process, from the beginning to the end of it. We were asked to be able to ask questions and listen all the answers and amazing thoughts. We were, sometimes, like a **teacher**, other time more like a **psychologist** or a ***friend*** and still other times we were just **silent auditors**. 

We must take always into account the so-called **empathic approach**. But that is not all, through co-design and empathic approach we didn't just put ourselves in someone's shoes, we gained a better understanding about other people's feelings, emotions, needs in order to make THEM (the participants, the citizens, the people) able to visualize and propose an **effective solution**, and its concept, to an existing "care" issue. 

Well, nuff said, if you want to organize a your own co-design session, don't be afraid of it. Read the following tips and you will be able to customize your own one. 

But keep in mind: *DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!*

### Tips

####Introduction:
If you have decided to keep on reading until here and further, then it means that you really want to test yourself and structure a co-design session (or you are just very curious and thirsty for knowledge, which is also great and well accepted).
Below you are going to find 9 tips, each one is structured as it follows:

####- Title
(simple rule-to-follow) // KEYWORDS (regarding the contents)

- **Description** (explanation of the rule)

- **In other words** (summarized elements and topics that you need to pay attention to)
- **opencare experience** (tip applied to our real experience in the **opencare** project, with pictures and comments related to the topic)

The aim of this core section is to give you information and proper knowledge in order to **get familiar** with the **strategic design **and emphatic activities.
Please, always keep in mind that collaborative design is not an **exact science**, and that every single element may vary depending on a number of factors. Take this as an **inspiration tool**, as a starting point, and then **jump** into the discipline, start testing, experiment, fail and then try again. Only in this way you will find the proper way to accomplish your real goals.
And remember: **have fun**!

####- Pay attention to the context // VARIETY - TONE OF VOICE - LANGUAGE
- **Description**

One of the first things that you need to understand is the **type of community** that you are involving or willing to involve.
###### In order to understand how to involve a local community, please check the chapter “How to involve citizens in a local community?”
If you decided to structure a co-design session it means that you have an aim, a strong reason; whether you are trying to **gather information** about a specific topic, or you are willing to **improve** the characteristics of your product/service with the help of your customers, or again you want to find an **innovative solution** to an identified problem, you need to **involve** a community of people.
Understanding your community is one of the first fundamental steps, because according to it you will have to **shape your tone of voice**.

Some people, for instance, may not understand technical terms on which your research is based on.
In this case you may want to choose one of the following options: **simplify** your language; **explain** during the process the meaning of those terms; **prepare** your audience in advance, giving them the possibility to face the reality they will have to jump into.
Therefore, if you are leading a research project you may have to work with people that are not necessarily experts/specialists, and that may have difficulties to understand the general context, if your language is too structured.

Another element you need to be careful about is the **delicacy** of the topic you are working on.
If you are willing to involve people in an activity that partly violates their **privacy**, or that regards personal information, you need to let them know in advance and we suggest you to be careful about the terms/activities you may want to use. It is important to protect them first, and then yourself, by being transparent with them about the use of the data and about sensitive information.

Lastly, consider the possibility of having a **various audience**. In this case you will have to adjust the tone of voice and activities in order to make every participant at the same level (if this is your aim, obviously). Remember that the aim of the collaborative design activity that you are structuring has to **be clear** to every single attendee, therefore your explanations will have to be structured in order to be understood by all of them.

- **In other words**

// **Modulate** your tone of voice according to your audience

// Make the aim and structure of the activity **clear** and** understandable**

// Pay attention to the **privacy** of participants and sensibility of the topic

// Evaluate the **variety **of the participants and shape your tone of voice accordingly

- **opencare experience**

During the definition of our co-design session we had to take into account a number of elements and characteristics that were crucial in order to obtain a successful activity.
First of all we had to relate with **various communities** and groups of people, characterized by **different ages** and **life experiences**.
Since we are talking about our **local experience**, it is important to underline that the main language we used was Italian. Some words, however, were written and pronounced in English (first among everything the title of the project: **opencare**). This was one of the main obstacles that we encountered, because some participants didn’t know the **foreign language**, therefore they had problems with understanding the meaning.

Another obstacle was related to the **complexity of terms** that are daily used in fablab/makerspace environments, but rarely in common situations.
In order to fix this problem on the one hand we **simplified** the language, on the other hand we organized some meetings and workshop with the aim of making the participants **get close **to the technologies and terminologies relevant for us.

Lastly, **privacy** has been a pressing issue for us.
Since **opencare** co-design session regarded personal stories related with **health** and **social care**, we clearly talked with the communities involved and pointed out that their stories would have been anonymously published on our online platform EdgeRyders, and that we would have recorded the activity itself with microphones and cameras. Those people who agreed signed a paper which stated that they had been informed and that they accepted to share all the generated content.
In this way we managed to protect both parties.

####- Point out the desired outcomes // GOALS
* **Description**

After understanding the context you are going to operate into it is time for you to think about the reason why you decided to structure this activity and the **deliverables** that you want to get once it will be finished.
This is an important step, because it will allow you to define the activities and the actions to undertake from now on.

If you will not define all the desired outcomes in a proper and satisfying way you may risk to end up with **nothing in your hands** (we know, it sounds like a dramatic sentence but it is more real than you can imagine).

Therefore try to answer to the following questions in the most detailed way:

* Why is a co-design session a **useful tool** for me?

* Who do I want to **involve**?

* What **kind of involvement** will I require from them?

* Why are these groups/communities/people important for the **achievement**?

* What do I want to **learn** from them and with them?

* What kind of materials do I necessarily need in order to **proceed with the work** after the session?


* Will I need any **visual** material?

* Will I need any **written** material?

* exc.

These are just some of the possible questions that you may try to answer. Some questions may not be useful in your specific case, some others may be crucial. The most important thing is ending up this phase with a **detailed list of outcomes**.

- **In other words**

// Ask yourself in detail what kind of **deliverable** you expect obtaining

// Write down the **answers** in order to refer to them at any time

// Make a list of your **essential goals**

- **opencare experience**

WeMake’s role inside the opencare project was, and is, mainly related with **collecting experiences** of community-driven care services.

The collection of experiences, however, is a previous step to another important action that we have to accomplish, which is the creation of one or more **prototypes**, based on the needs/solutions identified with the communities.
The development of the prototype was indeed a **steady focus point** in the editing of the list of outcomes.

Here you can see ours, that was later enhanced once we defined better our tools:

(our deliverables picture)

---
####- Define the elements/features // MODERATOR ROLES DATES
*establish the length, the number of sessions, the place, exc (nota bene...)*

---
- Find the right tools // CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 
*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))* - give an explanation to each tool

--- 

####- Keep the interest alive // WEBSITE - LANDING PAGE - NEWSLETTER - BLOGPOST
- **Description**

Once you have defined which kind of **communities** and **people** you are going to **collaborate** with, you are ready to start improving and enhancing the **relation** between your staff and your further participants. Obviously, there are plenty ways to engage and contact people, but keep in mind that the two main strategies, the online and offline one, are complementary since both of them are not totally efficient. One requires the other one and vice versa. In this tip we are going to talk about the **online channels** that we used to get more in touch with people. 

######*(if you want to know more about the offline activities please see “How to involve citizens in a local community” chapter)*

So, moving on, thanks to the new technologies, there are now many tools available to create links and connections between people. Moreover, there are plenty of channels given by the **global network**, such as: social networks, newsletters, blogs, forums, websites, exc. It is mandatory to choose the **right channels** in order to set up the right basis for a collaborative design approach. The choice mainly depends on which kind of informations you want to spread through those channels and to whom. 

Here some examples of the current *online* channels: 

* **Website**: it allows the final target to get the **most important informations** about the project. It must be as more clear, *functional* and understandable as possible. 
* Social networks: like “Facebook”, “Twitter”, “Google+”, “YouTube”, “Instagram” and so on. They are all different, but all of them lead to the same purpose which is to make a **large number of people** (even with different age) aware about some **imminent topics**. They must be updated continuously. 
* **Newsletter**: it can have different goals, like sending some discounts, updates, invitations to an event, exc. Be careful! It requires a *mailing list* and it must contain an interesting and winsome topic, otherwise it will be considered as **spam** and binned immediately. 
* **Blog**: it allows people to have an unfading **database** of informations and past events. It can be like a *diary* or a list of occurrences. There should be the possibility to leave a **comment** in order to allow people to start a discussion about a specific topic. It must be tidy, in other words, the staff must pay meticulous attention to organize all the posts and stories, they should be divided into categories by tags, dates, places, actors, keywords, exc. 
* **Forum**: as all the other online channels explained above, also the forum requires continuous *maintenance*. Maybe more than the other ones. It allows people to *discuss* about various topics, but still it is a perfect place to make **questions** and receive **replies** from both experts and principiants. This last point may be considered both a pros and cons, since the forum visitor can reach the accurate information required. It must have, especially at the beginning, some “**moderators**” who have to manage and oversee all the discussions. 

Try to answer to the following questions, they may give you the starting point which are useful to define your best online strategy:

* Which kind of **informations** do I want to spread?
* **Who** do I want to contact/inform/invite/...?
* Which is the **best channel** for my "target"?
* Does (Facebook) **fulfill** my purposes?
* How (Google+) can **contribute** to my project? 
* exc.

After choosing all these **key factors**, keep in mind that a pipeline will be more than appreciated. It is almost necessary to organize the releases in a strict **schedule** since it will make your staff able to define the roles and the timelines, who does what and when. It is a bit a time consuming at the beginning, but it will avoid further wasting time. Trust us, it is very helpful!

######*(see “How to involve an online community?” chapter for more details)*

- **In other words**

// Define **who** you want to get more in touch with

// Decide which kind of **informations** do you want to spread 

// Choose in which **channels** do you want to share your infos

// **Schedule** a pipeline of the content releases. 

- **opencare experience**

Since the beginning of our co-design experience, we have had to create a **solid online strategy**. Not only to involve the current online communities but even for bringing new local communities into it. We had to design and adapt all the contents, from time to time, to new channels according to the different phases of the co-design. In these last six months of activities we moved through two main parallel directions, one based on the **engagement** and the other one based on the aim to provide a **basic knowledge** about **opencare** project. 

So, first of all, we engaged people by means of **invitations** and **general posts** shared on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube), emails and our **blog**. 

(picture “OC-blogpost”)

Then we found out that an appropriate **basic knowledge** was necessary in order to have an efficient co-design with citizens, so we started to revise and re-design the **opencare website** and its **landing page**. 

(picture “OC-landingpage-01/02”)

But that is far from enough, we started sending a **newsletter** about some projects that might be useful for gaining a **first approach** and a **better understanding** of the wide world of open source products and services for care. In these newsletters we used colloquial words and expressions in a *three-questions template*. This because, since our “target” was mainly composed by “no-tinkerer people”, we wanted to make those projects as more comprehensible as possible to them. We wanted to **arouse curiosity** but at the same time we wanted to **make people feel valuable**. At the end of the newsletter we always put our *contacts*, and sometimes the invitation for a specific event (the two co-design sessions, some other workshops, exc).

(picture “OC-newsletter”)

####- Don’t underestimate the details // DAY SCHEDULE
- **Description**

As you can see in the previous tips, a **coordinated team** is mandatory during each co-design phase. The team must always to be able to communicate in the easier and most effective way. Moreover, the current design approach is requiring more and more kind of collaborations between people from different cities and/or even countries, and a **tidy coordination** would be a great help. 

There are a lot of **digital applications** that enable all the team members to collaborate even in remote working. These applications are not just useful to communicate, but they are also perfect in **organizing** the *timetables*, dividing the *roles*, accomplish the *tasks*, and so on.

So, try to not be afraid about these “innovative” apps that use up your *gigabytes*, infact they are designed for helping you in not underestimate the details of an entire project. Search for the best one for you, try and test it with your project managers and then share it with the rest of the team. You should trust in these apps. But if you prefer mostly the traditional tools, we recommend you to take a piece of paper and write down the classical “**To do list**” (explaining who-when-how) in order to not forget anything. 

- **In other words**

// Look for **new tools** that help you in organizing your and others’ work

// **Try and test** these apps with your project managers and then **share** them with all the team

// Make the **communication** and the **collaboration** between all your team members easy and effective

// Write down all the **tasks and roles** of a specific project, dividing them in a **timetable**

// Handle and hold the team as more **coordinated** as possible.

- **opencare experience**

In our experience, we have tested and used a lot of applications, mainly both for smartphone and laptop. Here there is a **list of some tools** that we are still using, keep in mind that it is not a promotion work, it is just a sharing of our successes and failures: 

* **Slack**: we use it to *communicate* to each other. It is very useful because it allows us to organize **different chat channels** according to the key sections of the main project. Within its pros, there is the fact that it is possible to create **bots**, which can send specific *notification* even from other applications. 
* **Hangout**: at the moment it is the best app to make sync and video call. It is especially recommended for remote working. It has also a chat window that allows the members to share and type external links. 
* **Google documents**: thanks to Google Drive, we are able to share and manage a huge amount of folders and file. We use Google applications mostly for everything, from typing a meeting minutes to organize a co-design session. Therefore we use them as parallel support of other applications. 
* **Asana**: it is very useful but at the same time it is a bit time consuming, especially at the beginning. But after a while it creates such a kind of dependence. It allows people to organize their own tasks but even to assignee some tasks to others. Surely, the strength point of this app is that everyone can see and check others’ tasks and set them according to a specific deadline. It has still some cons, but we are sure that Asana will be improved. 
* **EventBrite**: it is not the first time that we use EventBrite. It is very useful when you have to organize an event and you have to invite many people. It is a functional way to have an immediate feedback on who did the registration and who didn’t. But it is not just useful in preparing the event, it is very effective during the check in too. It is a fast way to know is someone will show up in the event. 

Obviously, you have to keep in mind that most of the time not all the registered people will show up in your great event! Then you have to be prepared to extemporize. But just to not be totally lost in this situation it might be very useful, especially a co-design session, a timing sheet about who does what, how and when. Of course, it should be written and showed to all the staff members before any kind of event, well in advance and preferably in a relaxed way.

(picture “OC-timing-01/2/3”)

- Be clear and complete about the project/meeting/outcomes // CLARITY - OPEN TRANSPARENCY
*explain clearly the roles, schedule of activities, project characteristics, goals, and answer in a complete way to every question/doubt of participants*

- Have fun but don't lose the focus // REWARD - BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE
*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement (in very step of the session - presentation, team work, break), but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*

- Keep the interest alive II // FEEDBACKS - UPDATES
*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.
