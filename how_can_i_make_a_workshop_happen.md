# How can I make a workshop happen? [Alessandro]

A hands-on workshop is usually a very good way to engage local communities and to find people interested in the project.
However organizing a workshop is also usually time intensive and requires a lot of effort in terms of research, planning, logistics and communication.

There are many different kinds of workshops you can offer to the community, but mostly they can be grouped in four main categories:
- Educational workshop
- Ideation workshop
- Experiential workshop
- Innovation workshop

Workshops can be approached in different ways according to the category they belong to, but there are common issues and best practices that we can cover and analyze separately:
### Space
There is no right or wrong space for a workshop, and usually a space can be adjusted to meet diverse needs. One thing for sure, it's very important to make participants feel comfortable and give them a warm welcome.

*Showing digital content:* if you are planning to project slides and/or show digital content, be sure you have access to a projector and the correct cables and adapters (if words like VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort are unknown to you, then you might need to check this list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_connectors)).
A couple of tips:

- prepare the <span class="tips">material</span> you want to show in a file format that is widely available and easily sharable. This is important in case you are not able to use your computer and you might need to use another machine to project your content.  
- As far as it may sound silly, it's always a good idea to find a good surface (preferably plain and white) to project to, the size of it being big enough so that everyone in the room can see/read
- Last but not least, always try to be sure the ratio between the brightness of the projector and the amount of light in the space is good enough so that everyone can see what you are projecting 



*Sitting VS standing:*
plan to have enough tables and chairs if the participants will need some kind of support plane to work on.

*Computers:*
power plugs, extension cords and multi-outlets are a must need when participants need to use laptops or powered devices without batteries. Rule of thumb here is "always bring one more"!

*Internet:*
access to a WiFi network can also be considered a must have (apart from sessions where it is requested to avoid using the Internet, are there any?). In case access to the Internet is fundamental to run the workshop (say for instance you are planning a workshop on Internet of Things tools), then please be sure to be ready with a plan B if the WiFi is not reliable:
- bring ethernet cables
- bring an access point you can quickly configure
- bring a GSM modem for worst case scenarios
