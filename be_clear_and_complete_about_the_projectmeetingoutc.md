# Be clear and complete about the project/meeting/outcomes

CLARITY - OPEN TRANSPARENCY

#### **// Description**

During each phase of a collaborative design experience, from the first [Inspiration](our_experience_in_co-design_field.md#inspiration-phase) to the last Recognition phase, you may have the possibility to meet and talk with many people with difference age, expertise, needs and passions. They might be not very interested in what you are going to propose and offer to them, just because they don't feel properly at ease.

As explained above, there are many subtle strategies for making people feel more aware and comfortable about a specific project and/or discussion, by means of informing them through default newsletter and quick blog posts. But when you are face to face with a **diverse audience** you might need a **presentation support**. 

#### **// In other words**
