# How to involve citizens in a local community? [Christina/Moushira]

Citizen involvement is a key part of the development of social innovations. Citizens are best placed to frame and articulate the nature of the social challenges they experience, so it is important that they are brought into any process of understanding needs. 

## Why we talk about community?
Communities are groups of citizens who decide to share their time in real and virtual spaces for different purposes. They are therefore citizens who have decided to develop social ties. When you start a collective participation process the advice is to start presenting the issues, challenges, projects in different communities to engage citizens who are more readily willing to participate. The goal will be to create a new community ready to share experiences, knowledge and skills.

## Why a local community?
Developing a local community is necessary to focus the strategy on deep human connections among participants using an empathetic and narrative approach. And it’s possible with a face to face collaborative action.
Engaging citizens in the development of care solutions, in particular, designing and testing solutions in real life settings with target users should help make those solutions more effective. Furthermore, working with citizens, drawing on and developing their assets and capabilities, helps support society’s resilience and capacity to act. 

##Why building a local community in a Fablab?

The Fablabs are open innovative places . Who enters into a FabLab is always the right person: you do not need technical requirements, qualifications, specific skills. The communities that develop inside the Fablab are" learning communities". They are founded on the sharing of experiences and knowledge.
In a Fablab citizens will produce light but meaningful social ties. Contexts in which light ties assume value generate inclusion and cohesion:  sharing of time and thoughts becomes significant . The awareness of acting in this context urges citizens to express themselves more freely ,in trust . Everyone learns something, increasing capability and empowerment.


## How to engage people in local community?

###Your Greatest Resources

This will help to start citizen engagement process and create a new local community care-centered:

- Identify the minimum number of people who want to be involved (this shows number of contacts that I will turn on and the kind of promotion that I'll have to activate)
- The type of citizen who intends to involve (young, female,  with specific characteristics...)
- The venues of the meetings (one, more than one, openspace, pubblic area... )
- The type of activity to be made in every place (presentation, needs analysis, solution identification, early design - ideas draft)
- The type of activity to be performed and the topics covered by group (more or less experiential, more involved, more frontal etc.)
- The type of output 

######*(see "General notes" subchapters for more details)*


###How many people I have to contact?
We recommend to map how many communities there are in your area and what are the characteristics of these communities: aims, age, gender and so on.
The citizens involved in communities have the greatest skills in listening, and are used to collaborative practices.
Then you have to choose four or five communities with different characteristics.
The first step to involve citizens of different communities is inform and share goals, timing, methods and tools.

In OpenCare project we met “active” communities in Milan in order to engage citizens: citizen/groups of people used to collaborate in order to find solutions to emergent social needs or care-related solutions.

Opencare local team (WeMake and Municipality of Milan) contacts four communities

Elderly people with a common passion: dancing 
Parents of disabled childrens
Migrants 
A “Social street”


###What kind of event I have to organize to facilitate the participation of citizens?
The first meeting with the citizens has to be an informal event: party, happy hour, an evening of dancing, an experiential workshop. The goal must be to present yourself and the goal for which you require the participation. An informal meeting facilitates interaction and trust-building between people. 

In the meeting we must provide time for the presentation:
- who are you
- what do you want
- Why did you choose that community
- How you intend to achieve your goal

###Goals - Why involve citizens in a participatory process this time?
To involve citizens it is necessary to establish a relation of trust and answer this question. The reasons may be different:
1. to test a new methodology
2. to inform people about something and collect their opinions
3. to test a process or a product
4. To design a new service or product 
5. ...

In OpenCare project the goals is to involve citizens in co-design session to encorage citizens:
* to emergence of their needs or obstacles in their life
* to define solutions to respond to individual or collective local problems.

### Methodology - How involve citizens in a participatory process?

You should not use technical language or too difficult. Express yourself in an easy way. The presentation should be short and possibly not frontal. Then you should sit down with the people and talk to them and verify that they have understood what you have said. We recommend using storytelling and bringing them solutions that can be touched to facilitate communication and to encourage an empathetic approach.

The location is very important. The first event can be hosted by the community you have contacted.  You have to offer food, drinks, music or whatever. 

####tips and tricks

Every person who has an interest in, or who could be affected by, the issues under discussion must be encouraged to take part.
Be clear at the start about what changes your project can or cannot promise and be clear about the mechanisms of the decision-making processes
Be sure you give people as much information as possible and explain where information is missing or is uncertain.
Show respect for diverse views and cultures by making sure that minority views are taken on board. This is your opportunity to build trust by being courteous,empathic and helpful.
Use existing channels to make sure that you report back to all interested people as fully and as quickly as possible.
Put final decisions into action as soon as possible. This will strengthen participants’ belief that their involvement was worthwhile.

####Keeping in touch





####workshops
Why is a workshop good for the community?
- it makes people share an experience in a informal way, creating a space of trust and making them feeling less isolated as a result
- it makes people collaborate to solve concrete problems
- it makes people feel empowered when facing again at issues in their everyday life

Why is a workshop good for you?
- it creates trust in you by the community
- it makes the people in the community understand the limits of what you are planning to do
- it gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project
- people might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project

### General notes

If your project is inspired by an idea that helps your local community, make sure your emphasis the fact that it can help solve a problem or create opportunities in your local community.
1. **Language:** Make sure your communicate in languages that are understandable by your local community
2. **Relate to your community problems**, present your project from the scope of the local community
If you are replicating/localizing an existing global project make sure your localize your materials to make it easy to involve your local community.
3.**Understand your local community: ** Spend time understanding why they are interested in your project.  Make sure you engage them in the scope they are interested in, for example: A geek who wants to tinker has a different interest from a person who wants to eventually use your project/product

####Find your Friends?
1.Which **makerspaces** can help you work on your project?
2.If there is no makerspace nearby, can you host sessions in a near **co-working** space?
3.If you don't have makerpaces or co-working or any modern facility, can you meet at the library or community center in the **neighbourhood?** (with this approach, however, you need to have existing team and community to start with)
4.If your project relates to a medical cause, or industrial, or elderly, etc, layout the scope of your project, and reach out to **related organizations**, or groups 

####What are the activities  that help grow a local community?
Depending on which stage your project is in, there are a number of activities that you can carry out:
1. **An ideation workshop**,  A workshop where people share their thoughts around similar solutions of the project/product you are producing.
2. **A Hackathon** if you have a list of tasks that need to be added to your project you may want to organize an event and ask people to contribute specific things.
3. **A testing workhoshop**: A session where you test early prototypes with the community, let them use it, take notes and learn from their feedback.

####Connecting the dots:
1. Make sure you **build connections** between the community of the makerspace and the new community that your bring for your project.
2. Ensure that the local community can **work together** nicely.
3. In tech projects, **female participation ** could be challenging. Make sure females in your project are welcomed, trusted and can participate freely in areas that they are interested in.
4. **Follow up after the meeting**: Whether you have a facebook group, or another online venue that the local community is found together on, make sure you follow up and remain in contact.
