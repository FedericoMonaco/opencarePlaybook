If you have decided to keep on reading until here and further, then it means that you really want to test yourself and structure a co-design session (or you are just very curious and thirsty for knowledge, which is also great and well accepted).
Below you are going to find 9 tips, each one is structured as it follows:

---
 
####Title *(simple rule-to-follow)*
KEYWORDS *(regarding the contents)*

**// Description** *(explanation of the rule)*

**// In other words** *(summarized elements and topics that you need to pay attention to)*

**// opencare experience** *(tip applied to our real experience in the **opencare** project, with pictures and comments related to the topic)*

The aim of this core section is to give you information and proper knowledge in order to **get familiar** with the **strategic design **and emphatic activities.
Please, always keep in mind that collaborative design is not an **exact science**, and that every single element may vary depending on a number of factors. Take this as an **inspiration tool**, as a starting point, and then **jump** into the discipline, start testing, experiment, fail and then try again. Only in this way you will find the proper way to accomplish your real goals.

And remember: **have fun**!
