# How to involve a local community? [Christina/Moushira]
Citizen involvement is a key part of the development of social innovations. Citizens are best placed to frame and articulate the nature of the social challenges they experience, so it is important that they are brought into any process of understanding needs. 

## Why we talk about community?
Communities are groups of citizens who decide to share their time in real and virtual spaces for different purposes. They are therefore citizens who have decided to develop social ties. When you start a collective participation process the advice is to start presenting the issues, challenges, projects in different communities to engage citizens who are more readily willing to participate. The goal will be to create a new community ready to share experiences, knowledge and skills.

## Why a local community?
Developing a local community is necessary to focus the strategy on deep human connections among participants using an empathetic and narrative approach. And it’s possible with a face to face collaborative action.
Engaging citizens in the development of care solutions, in particular, designing and testing solutions in real life settings with target users should help make those solutions more effective. Furthermore, working with citizens, drawing on and developing their assets and capabilities, helps support society’s resilience and capacity to act. 

##Why building a local community in a Fablab?

The Fablabs are open innovative places . Who enters into a FabLab is always the right person: you do not need technical requirements, qualifications, specific skills. The communities that develop inside the Fablab are" learning communities". They are founded on the sharing of experiences and knowledge.
In a Fablab citizens will produce light but meaningful social ties. Contexts in which light ties assume value generate inclusion and cohesion:  sharing of time and thoughts becomes significant . The awareness of acting in this context urges citizens to express themselves more freely ,in trust . Everyone learns something, increasing capability and empowerment.



## How to engage people in local community?

###Your Greatest Resources
We recommend to map how many communities there are in your area and what are the characteristics of these communities: aims, age, gender and so on.
Then you have to choose four or five communities with different characteristics.



### How do I reach local communities?

### How do I pitch my idea?

### What do I have to offer?
####workshops
Why is a workshop good for the community?
- it makes people share an experience in a informal way, creating a space of trust and making them feeling less isolated as a result
- it makes people collaborate to solve concrete problems
- it makes people feel empowered when facing again at issues in their everyday life

Why is a workshop good for you?
- it creates trust in you by the community
- it makes the people in the community understand the limits of what you are planning to do
- it gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project
- people might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project

### General notes

If your project is inspired by an idea that helps your local community, make sure your emphasis the fact that it can help solve a problem or create opportunities in your local community.
1. **Language:** Make sure your communicate in languages that are understandable by your local community
2. **Relate to your community problems**, present your project from the scope of the local community
If you are replicating/localizing an existing global project make sure your localize your materials to make it easy to involve your local community.
3.**Understand your local community: ** Spend time understanding why they are interested in your project.  Make sure you engage them in the scope they are interested in, for example: A geek who wants to tinker has a different interest from a person who wants to eventually use your project/product

####Find your Friends?
1.Which **makerspaces** can help you work on your project?
2.If there is no makerspace nearby, can you host sessions in a near **co-working** space?
3.If you don't have makerpaces or co-working or any modern facility, can you meet at the library or community center in the **neighbourhood?** (with this approach, however, you need to have existing team and community to start with)
4.If your project relates to a medical cause, or industrial, or elderly, etc, layout the scope of your project, and reach out to **related organizations**, or groups 

####What are the activities  that help grow a local community?
Depending on which stage your project is in, there are a number of activities that you can carry out:
1. **An ideation workshop**,  A workshop where people share their thoughts around similar solutions of the project/product you are producing.
2. **A Hackathon** if you have a list of tasks that need to be added to your project you may want to organize an event and ask people to contribute specific things.
3. **A testing workhoshop**: A session where you test early prototypes with the community, let them use it, take notes and learn from their feedback.

####Connecting the dots:
1. Make sure you **build connections** between the community of the makerspace and the new community that your bring for your project.
2. Ensure that the local community can **work together** nicely.
3. In tech projects, **female participation ** could be challenging. Make sure females in your project are welcomed, trusted and can participate freely in areas that they are interested in.
4. **Follow up after the meeting**: Whether you have a facebook group, or another online venue that the local community is found together on, make sure you follow up and remain in contact.
