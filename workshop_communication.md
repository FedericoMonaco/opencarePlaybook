## Workshop Communication

You are ready to start your workshop, then don't forget to let people know your amazing workshop is taking place!
When communicating your workshop is always a good idea to make clear:
- what is the topic in a clear and intuitive way
- why your workshop is interesting and cool
- what they will learn/make during the session
- who is teaching it
- where and when it is taking place
- how they can sign-up (if it's for free or they have to pay a fee)
- what they need to bring

|**Communicate your workshop to your community through the right online and offline channels depending on the demography of your peculiar target**: newsletter, blog post, posts on social networks, flyers, postcards, sms...|
|In our direct experience we combined communication on different levels (weekly newsletter, blog posts, posts on facebook and twitter) since our target group was very varied. *For more info on our experience please refer to ["Keep the interest alive" chapter](keep_the_interest_alive.md)* |
|**It's very important to keep the communication alive also when the workshop is over**. A follow up with pictures, a video and wrap up is always a good idea to engage the participants in the project!|
