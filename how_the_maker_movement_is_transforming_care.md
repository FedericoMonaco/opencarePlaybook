# How the maker movement is transforming care


Daelyn James, 14, likes to make things.With just some wooden sticks, an electric fan, and some plastic rings made with a 3D printer, Daelyn built a device to help kids with Cystic Fibrosis dry their nebulizers. An innovative solution homemade.

The maker movement demystifies and democratizes care device design.Whatâ€™s exciting about the maker movement in care is that the possibilities are endless and can come from anywhere. From low-tech to high-tech solutions makers are solving real problems for patients, often at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical equipment. And in many cases, citizens themselves are the makers, like Daelyn.
