# Our workshop experience
During our first months of the opencare project we held a series of workshops to help engaging the local community.
We share here our experience with the hope that it will be useful as a starting point to set up more workshops, or as an experience that can replicated somewhere else in future opencare local communities.

During this workshop participants will learn hands-on how to use one of the most common technology solutions about creating open source care solutions, and they will create an IoT monitoring service in just a few hours. In an international setting where citizens' care and healthcare is considered a growing social issue and cannot be guaranteed to anyone, opencare tries to find solutions real life care issues leveraging on the experience and help of local and online communities using innnovative, low cost and open source technologies.
