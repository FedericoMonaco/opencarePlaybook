# How can I make a prototype?
Hard to say! Jokes apart, there are many ways to approach the making of a prototype and in the end it really comes down to what is the best for YOU to create a prototype.
Because of this it is hard to learn that from a book, you rather learn by doing instead, which in the end means failing, and repeating, and iterating over and over to perfect your project and your methodology at the same time!

That said, in this chapter we'll try to give you an overview of what we have found to be a good methodology and useful technologies to create technological devices using tools and machines like the ones available in a Makerspace or Fablab.

## Is there a process I can follow?
design process, what it is, why it's powerful, how you can use it for prototyping

??? 
- different kinds of prototypes
- testing for feedback
- prototyping with hardware
