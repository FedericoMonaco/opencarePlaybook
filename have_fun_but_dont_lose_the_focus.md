# Have fun but don't lose the focus

BREAK - RELAXED ATMOSPHERE - REWARD

#### **// Description**

In every step of a co-design session, from the check-in to the check-out, it is very important to have a **flexible attitude**. In the meaning that the organizational team has always to keep in mind that **the participants might not be familiar** in doing some activities and reasonings which are required by the collaborative design approach.

Therefore, it might be very appreciated having some **quick breaks** in the meanwhile of the session. This will help the participants to **be more active and efficient**. These breaks change according to the situation, they can be just a light joke during the presentation or a delicuous buffet at the end of the teamwork. 

The breaks must be organized in the advance, possibly together with the **schedule/timing** of the session. So, the team is going to be as **tidy** and **coordinated** as possible.

###### See [Don't underestimate the details](dont_underestimate_the_details.md) tip for gaining more insights about the timing sheet. 

But please be aware and don't underestimate the **unpredictable aspect** of the participatory design. The organizational staff (composed almost by mentors, organizers, speakers and designers) has to be able to understand when it is time to change tone of voice, being more ironic or **playful** and when it is time to have a more serious and **demanding** approach.



#### **// In other words**

* Make the participants **feel comfortable** and **active**
* Provide them the right **assistance** and **tools** 
* Understand when it is time to have a **quick break** and when it is time to go **back to work**
* Be able to **handle different moments**.

#### **// opencare experience**

*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement (in every step of the session - presentation, team work, break), but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*
