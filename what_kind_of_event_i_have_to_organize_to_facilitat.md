Why is a workshop good for the community?

- It makes people share an experience in a informal way, creating a space of trust and making them feeling less isolated as a result;

Why is a workshop good for you?

- It creates trust in you by the community;

- It gives you an opportunity to spot people interested in developing or testing the project;
- People might share their experience creating a natural amplification channel for the communication of the project.
