Epochal changes in science, technology and globalization have transformed traditional power structures in the world, opening the way for citizens to participate in society in a way that they could not before. And change is accelerating. While we do not know what tomorrowâ€™s problems are going to be, we know there will be many, and we know we will need everyone equipped to deal with them. 
We all must be emphatic innovators, able to collaborate, create, and act in changing environments. 

**opencare** Playbook aka "Co-designing care services: a practical guide" is a little contribute for all innovators who wants to start to make a change in their community.

The Playbook describes a general path for starting collaborative processes that you can adapt as needed. The playbook is related to engagement processes (local and online), co-design sessions, prototyping and sharing documentation as parts of the entire process.

* Co-design as the collective detection of troubles and solutions 

* [Prototyping](../how_can_i_make_a_prototype.md) as a the making of a service or a device from a concept
