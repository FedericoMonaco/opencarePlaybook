# Keep the interest alive - Part II

FEEDBACKS - UPDATES

#### **// Description**

Congratulation! If you are reading this last tip you have arrived at one **great point** for your participatory design, but there is still something else to do. 

A complete co-design experience needs also a "**post-phase**", that we called "[Recognition Phase](Our_experience_in_co-design_filed.md#recognition-phase)", which requires a **strict maintenance** and an **organizational capability**.  

As **before** the actual co-design sessions (during which people get their hands dirty) there is, most of the time, a *determined strategy* in engaging and involving people by means of meetings, newsletter, exc as **after** the co-design sessions there should be an *ambitious strategy* as well. 

This strategy can be handled in various ways and through different tools, but it always has a specific goal: making people aware about the **project updates** by receiving and exchanging feedbacks. **Offline and online involvement** are both pretty efficient. 

The tools might be the same of those used for the involvement of the communities, but, obviously the informations are going to change in the *layout* and in the *content*. The new informations should be still interesting and able to **provoke the curiosity** of the people. 

###### See [Keep the interest alive - Part I](keep_the_interest_alive.md) tip for more details about the different involving online channels.

#### **// In other words**

* **Don't lose the contact** with the participants

* **Keep them involved** even after the sessions

* **Show them the results**, **exchange feedbacks** and keep them **up to date** about the past sessions and the further project

* **Make a list** about the **new ways** and **tools** that you want to use in this phase

* Be **captivating**, spontaneous and clear

* **Schedule** a timetable.

#### **// opencare experience**

After our two co-design sessions, we tried to **not lose the contact** with the participants, who were very interested and *enthusiastic* about the co-design experience. So, first of all, we decided to organize a third meeting **after few days** from the second session. This because we found out that after two evenings of **great workout** a more **relaxing and sharing time** is the least we could do to **appreciate their efforts.**  

This meeting was totally different from the previous two collaborative and productive sessions, it was more like an **aperitif** open to *discussions* and **prompt feedbacks**. 

We didn't declare just the winner project, we explained and **illustrated** to the audience how we have managed **the entire selection process** indeed. In this way we gave them the possibility to be aware and to feel **integral part** of the project. Therefore, after the slide presentation, the participants were **ready to start a discussion**, explaining their doubts and considerations about our choise and decisions. 
It was a very interesting moment of sharing knowledges and ways of thinking. 

After the presentation and **exchange of views**, we enjoyed greatly the end of the meeting and the end of our first co-design experience with a delicious buffet.

###### See [Recognition Phase](Our_experience_in_co-design_filed.md#recognition-phase) paragraph to read any detail of the meeting. 

Last but not least, we continued to publish some **blog posts** and send the **newsletter** about some case studies, in order to **keep the interest alive** until we are going to start the **prototyping phase**.
