# Keep the interest alive - Part II

FEEDBACKS - UPDATES

#### **// Description**

Congratulation! If you are reading this last tip you have arrived at one **great point** for your participatory design, but there is still something else to do. 

A complete co-design experience needs also a "**post-phase**", that we called "[Recognition](Our_experience_in_co-design_filed.md#recognition-phase) Phase", which requires a **strict maintenance** and an **organizational capability**.  

As **before** the actual co-design sessions (during which people get their hands dirty) there is, most of the time, a *determined strategy* in engaging and involving people by means of meetings, newsletter, exc as **after** the co-design sessions there should be an *ambitious strategy* as well. 

This strategy can be handled in various ways and through different tools, but it always has a specific goal: making people aware about the **project updates** by receiving and exchanging feedbacks. 

The tools might be the same of those used for the involvement of the communities, but, obviously the informations are going to change in the *layout* and in the *content*. The new informations should be still interesting and able to provoke the curiosity of the people.

#### **// In other words**

* **Don't lose the contact** with the participants

* **Keep them involved** even after the sessions

* **Show them the results**, **exchange feedbacks** and keep them **up to date** about the past sessions and the further project

* **Make a list** about the **new ways** and **tools** that you want to use in this phase

* Be **captivating**, spontaneous and clear

* **Schedule** a timetable.

#### **// opencare experience**

*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session (show them the results of the sessions).* Explain our situation, our transparency in the selection process.

After our two co-design sessions, we tried to **not lose the contact** with the participants, who were very interesting and *enthusiastic* about the co-design experience. So, first of all, we decided to organize a third meeting after few days from the second session. 

**Aperitif - June 1st, 2016**

The last meeting with the communities was totally different from the previous two collaborative sessions. This one was more an **aperitif**,
