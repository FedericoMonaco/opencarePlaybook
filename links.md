Below are some links which you can find useful, in the context of developing your opensource project and the community around it.

###Design thinking and where to start:

Design thinking is a practice that helps people visualize the different aspects of their project, the project impact, and how to test and evaluate. If you have an idea, design thinking workshop, might be one practice that can help you, explain your idea to your audiance and makerspace where you present, and helps you grow a community around your project. It also helps you plan your testing in order to evaluate your thinking.

[IdeoU](http://www.ideou.com/), a platform run by [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com) the leading design for humans company. It offers courses, and useful classes.

[DesignKit](http://www.designkit.org), another kit developed by [IDEO](http://www.ideo.org/), that helps understand and plan concept of design research, even if you are not expert in the filed.

[Collective Design](http://www.frogdesign.com/sites/default/files/pdf/frog_collective_action_toolkit.pdf), similar to the above, but adopting a different methodology, the kit is developed by Frog, another leading human centered design agency.

#### Making things:

We already explained a some techniques on how to make your prototype, below are links to further technologies that you can use, and will be useful to learn about, in order to plan what technologies and processes do you need.

[Arduino ](https://www.arduino.cc, a treasure board that empowers anyone to work with sensors, data and devices, without even necessarily being an engineer

[Fritzing,](http://fritzing.org/home/) a very easy tool that helps you design your circuits, explore concepts and learn about electricity.

[Fab Academy course](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/index_english.html), a great resource to learn about how to use the different fabrication technologies and how to design basic circuits.
