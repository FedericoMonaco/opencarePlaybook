# How can I structure a co-design session? [Silvia and Chiara]


### Introduction
* Why we used/made a co-design (advantages-risks-exc)
* How we structured this chapter (intro-tips-examples-general overview)
* Note: The examples are the real tools used during the first co-design experience made in WeMake (few details) - Don't try this at home!

### Tips

- Pay attention to the context // VARIETY - TONE OF VOICE - LANGUAGE
*think about the community you are involving (nota bene...)*

- Point out the desired outcomes // GOALS
*try to understand clearly your goals and what you want to achieve* 

- Define the elements/features // MODERATOR ROLES DATES
*establish the lenght, the number of sessions, the place, exc (nota bene...)*

- Find the right tools // CARDS - METHODOLOGIES 
*give a look to the existing co-design tools, in the case they don't fit your need design your own (our tools: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwAI5ErUduFMCBR-aqrXbruB3aEabt_L1xGUSluKv8g/edit#))*

- Keep the interest alive // NEWSLETTER - BLOGPOSTS
*make the community interested and involved, give them updates and make them feel valuable (explain how we involve/engage people and why, for example: local communities > awareness > newsletter)*

- Don't understimate the details // DAY SCHEDULE
*schedule in advance team meetings to define the tight schedules of the sessions, keep in mind some relax/free moments be sure that someone will show up* 

- Have fun but don't lose the focus // CLARITY - OPEN TRANSARENCY
*make the participants feel comfortable, offer them some rewards for their efforts and involvement, but be sure to reach your goals (nota bene... be not repetitive, exc)*

- Keep the interest alive II // FEEDBACKS - UPDATES
*once you get the involvement of the community you should do your best to keep them involved even after the session.*
