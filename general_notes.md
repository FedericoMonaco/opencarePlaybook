## Tips

If your project is inspired by an idea that helps your local community, make sure your emphasis the fact that it can help solve a problem or create opportunities in your local community:

* **Language:** Make sure your communicate in languages that are understandable by your local community;
*  **Relate to your community problems**, present your project from the scope of the local community;

If you are replicating/localizing an existing global project make sure your localize your materials to make it easy to involve your local community.

* **Understand your local community: ** Spend time understanding why they are interested in your project. Make sure you engage them in the scope they are interested in, for example: A geek who wants to tinker has a different interest from a person who wants to eventually use your project/product.

#### // Find your friends?

1. Which **makerspaces** can help you work on your project?

2. If there is no makerspace nearby, can you host sessions in a near **co-working** space?

3. If you don't have makerpaces or co-working or any modern facility, can you meet at the library or community center in the **neighbourhood?** (with this approach, however, you need to have existing team and community to start with)

4. If your project relates to a medical cause, or industrial, or elderly, etc, layout the scope of your project, and reach out to **related organizations**, or groups 

#### // Connecting the dots:

1. Make sure you **build connections** between the community of the makerspace and the new community that your bring for your project;
2. Ensure that the local community can **work together** nicely;
3. In tech projects, **female participation ** could be challenging. Make sure females in your project are welcomed, trusted and can participate freely in areas that they are interested in;
4. **Follow up after the meeting**: Whether you have a facebook group, or another online venue that the local community is found together on, make sure you follow up and remain in contact.
