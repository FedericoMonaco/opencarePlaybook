# Is there a process I can follow?
design process, what it is, why it's powerful, how you can use it for prototyping

In our experience of years of making projects, helping people to make projects and teaching students how to make projects, we have found out that the **Design Process** is the one that covers all the basic aspects of prototyping solutions. It usually works seamlessly in a variety of fields, contexts and technologies involved.

A user-centered design process usually follows these five steps.

Rather than being a strict set of rules it's more like a series of different stages of a flow that ends up in a possibly endless loop of iterations. Sometimes it tends to feel so natural you won't even feel you are following a methodology.


### How does it work then?
***DISCOVER - ***Sometimes you start with a brilliant idea, lucky you! Most of the times you actually start by just facing a need or a series of needs. Those needs they usually have emerged in a certain context. As the first step you define this context, the area you are going to work in.

You analyze and try to find out:
* who are the stakeholders involved
* what kind of characteristics does the context have

For instance, an issue deeply related to shortness of breath may have a bigger impact on a community of people doing tyring manual labor rather than a desk job. 

***SYNTHESIZE - ***If the first phase of research will help you focus on the area of the problem, this second phase will help you define the problem and the people affected by it. The people you are gonna work for and with, your users.
